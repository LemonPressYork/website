Nationally recognised, The Lemon Press is one of York's\n          most established and most awarded print media organisations. The print edition is produced\n          once a term, with an additional freshers' edition, and online content is produced on a\n          constant basis. Online, The Lemon Press has a national reach, with videos reaching almost\n          400,000 people. The Lemon Press has recently branched out onto new platforms, including a\n          TikTok and Instagram, and our Multi-Media wing was recently responsible for a Call-To-Arms\n          for supporters of exiled YUSU President Chris Small, which played before a screening of\n          Cats at the student cinema.\n        </p>\n        <div style={{ gridColumn: \"8/13\" }}>\n          <img\n            src=\"https://image.freepik.com/free-photo/group-coworkers-office-talking_23-2148985522.jpg\"\n            style={{ width: \"100%\" }}\n          />\n          <p>\n            <i>Pretty much a standard lemon press meeting</i>\n          </p>\n        </div>\n        <div style={{ gridColumn: \"1/5\" }}>\n          <img\n            src=\"https://www.publicdomainpictures.net/pictures/220000/nahled/beautiful-bar-in-amsterdam.jpg\"\n            style={{ width: \"100%\" }}\n          />\n          <p>\n            <i>D Bar on a cool winters night</i>\n          </p>\n        </div>\n        <p style={{ gridColumn: \"6/13\", display: \"flex\", alignItems: \"center\" }}>\n          Being part of The Lemon Press is collaborative, it's a great way to get involved with\n          Student Politics, and other Media Societies.

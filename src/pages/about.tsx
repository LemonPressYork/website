          The Lemon Press is one of only a handful of university satire publications in the U.K.,
          and has a history of excellence. Nationally recognised, The Lemon Press is one of York's
          most established and most awarded print media organisations. The print edition is produced
          once a term, with an additional freshers' edition, and online content is produced on a
          constant basis. Online, The Lemon Press has a national reach, with videos reaching almost
          400,000 people. The Lemon Press has recently branched out onto new platforms, including a
          TikTok and Instagram, and our Multi-Media wing was recently responsible for a Call-To-Arms
          for supporters of exiled YUSU President Chris Small, which played before a screening of
          Cats at the student cinema.

          Being part of The Lemon Press is collaborative, it's a great way to get involved with
          Student Politics, and other Media Societies. We report on the YUSU Elections each year,
          and our radio show is looking for new presenters. We hold joint socials with York Vision,
          and have screenings in the Student Cinema.

In the famous interview, Bashir asked if Diana regretted her choice of words during her Dark Souls speedruns, and whether or not such heated gamer moments had a place in the gaming community. The interview not only called Diana’s gamer skills into question, but also stimulated thought-provoking discussions about the royal family’s role in modern Britain. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the footage of her royal highness, apparently in fits of intense gamer rage, were recently discovered to be deepfakes. The investigation that followed resulted in the resignation of Bashir from the BBC and the revived adoration of Diana by streamers all over the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>James Rhodes</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Photo credit <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/51764518@N02/48082198307\">https://www.flickr.com/photos/51764518@N02/48082198307</a></em></p>\n","title":"‘There Were Three of Us in This Twitch Stream’: Bashir Admits Faking Footage of Princess Diana’s Gamer Meltdowns","date":"October 16, 2021","author":{"node":{"id":"dXNlcjox","avatar":{"url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/9efbc643bbcb6227dd47e272eb566de7?s=96&d=mm&r=g"},"description":"Articles from the past and present team at The Lemon Press!","firstName":"Lemon Press","lastName":"Writers"}},"featuredImage":{"node":{"altText":"","localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/21a51f277e1b1d80bb77d73dd6d72855/01c5e/48082198307_6d4b317ebc_k-1.jpg","srcSet":"/static/21a51f277e1b1d80bb77d73dd6d72855/292ac/48082198307_6d4b317ebc_k-1.jpg 750w,\n/static/21a51f277e1b1d80bb77d73dd6d72855/94a0c/48082198307_6d4b317ebc_k-1.jpg 1080w,\n/static/21a51f277e1b1d80bb77d73dd6d72855/b9445/48082198307_6d4b317ebc_k-1.jpg 1366w,\n/static/21a51f277e1b1d80bb77d73dd6d72855/01c5e/48082198307_6d4b317ebc_k-1.jpg 1920w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/21a51f277e1b1d80bb77d73dd6d72855/57119/48082198307_6d4b317ebc_k-1.avif 750w,\n/static/21a51f277e1b1d80bb77d73dd6d72855/87009/48082198307_6d4b317ebc_k-1.avif 1080w,\n/static/21a51f277e1b1d80bb77d73dd6d72855/653b6/48082198307_6d4b317ebc_k-1.avif 1366w,\n/static/21a51f277e1b1d80bb77d73dd6d72855/7f33d/48082198307_6d4b317ebc_k-1.avif 1920w","type":"image/avif","sizes":"100vw"},{"srcSet":"/static/21a51f277e1b1d80bb77d73dd6d72855/28d58/48082198307_6d4b317ebc_k-1.webp 750w,\n/static/21a51f277e1b1d80bb77d73dd6d72855/c2d64/48082198307_6d4b317ebc_k-1.webp 1080w,\n/static/21a51f277e1b1d80bb77d73dd6d72855/b61d3/48082198307_6d4b317ebc_k-1.webp 1366w,\n/static/21a51f277e1b1d80bb77d73dd6d72855/6f14b/48082198307_6d4b317ebc_k-1.webp 1920w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"100vw"}]},"width":1,"height":0.7619791666666667}}}}}},"previous":{"slug":"the-tlp-guide-to-rigging-a-university-election","title":"The TLP Guide to Rigging a University Election"},"next":{"slug":"build-a-bear-announce-margaret-thatcher-bear","title":"Build-a-Bear Announce Margaret Thatcher Bear."}},"pageContext":{"id":"cG9zdDoxNzk=","previousPostId":"cG9zdDoxODQ=","nextPostId":"cG9zdDoxNzQ="}},

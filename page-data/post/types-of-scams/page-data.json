This is our guide to scams to help you become more aware:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Phishing Scam:</strong> The price of Ben &amp; Jerry&#8217;s Phish food in the vending machine is a scam. The price is unbelievably high and the tubs are even smaller than you’d think. Avoid if possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Fishing Scam: </strong>We’re pretty sure fish can’t survive the toxic waters that surround the University of York, any attempt to convince you to feed the fish as some sort of romantic activity is a con. You’re more likely to be throwing fish food into someone&#8217;s discarded vape.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Free Pizza At Society Meetings and Elections:</strong> I’ve never actually been to a society meeting but I just don’t really believe it to be honest. You always hear stories about how people turn up after the pizza is gone as though it was ever there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dog Society:</strong> Buying the DogSoc membership just before dog meet ups had to be suspended due to insurance issues, very annoyed. Not really a scam I guess because it’s been fixed now but I just needed to vent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>YuSnow:</strong> Not really a skiing society, it only snows once or twice a year in York at best. No point really is there?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Matt Davis</em></p>\n","title":"Types of Scams","date":"July 08, 2022","author":{"node":{"id":"dXNlcjox","avatar":{"url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/9efbc643bbcb6227dd47e272eb566de7?s=96&d=mm&r=g"},"description":"Articles from the past and present team at The Lemon Press!","firstName":"Lemon Press","lastName":"Writers"}},"featuredImage":{"node":{"altText":"","localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/de2454037e28e5e436f13e920a5187b9/19776/phishing-g642b6202f_1920.jpg","srcSet":"/static/de2454037e28e5e436f13e920a5187b9/29113/phishing-g642b6202f_1920.jpg 750w,\n/static/de2454037e28e5e436f13e920a5187b9/f25f2/phishing-g642b6202f_1920.jpg 1080w,\n/static/de2454037e28e5e436f13e920a5187b9/03f6c/phishing-g642b6202f_1920.jpg 1366w,\n/static/de2454037e28e5e436f13e920a5187b9/19776/phishing-g642b6202f_1920.jpg 1920w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/de2454037e28e5e436f13e920a5187b9/0b410/phishing-g642b6202f_1920.avif 750w,\n/static/de2454037e28e5e436f13e920a5187b9/316b2/phishing-g642b6202f_1920.avif 1080w,\n/static/de2454037e28e5e436f13e920a5187b9/24302/phishing-g642b6202f_1920.avif 1366w,\n/static/de2454037e28e5e436f13e920a5187b9/34b27/phishing-g642b6202f_1920.avif 1920w","type":"image/avif","sizes":"100vw"},{"srcSet":"/static/de2454037e28e5e436f13e920a5187b9/27d7e/phishing-g642b6202f_1920.webp 750w,\n/static/de2454037e28e5e436f13e920a5187b9/06ef5/phishing-g642b6202f_1920.webp 1080w,\n/static/de2454037e28e5e436f13e920a5187b9/5888e/phishing-g642b6202f_1920.webp 1366w,\n/static/de2454037e28e5e436f13e920a5187b9/11e1f/phishing-g642b6202f_1920.webp 1920w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"100vw"}]},"width":1,"height":0.6499999999999999}}}}}},"previous":{"slug":"love-york-branding-pulled-after-everyone-who-loves-york-dies-in-freak-accident","title":"Love York Branding Pulled After Everyone Who Loves York Dies in Freak Accident"},"next":{"slug":"daddy-issues-our-issues-with-father-time","title":"Daddy Issues: Our Issues With Father Time"}},"pageContext":{"id":"cG9zdDozMjg=","previousPostId":"cG9zdDozMzQ=","nextPostId":"cG9zdDozMjI="}},

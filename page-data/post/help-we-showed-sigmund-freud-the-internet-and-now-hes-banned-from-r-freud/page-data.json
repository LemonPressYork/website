We got together and brought Sigmund Frued back to life (please don&#8217;t ask, it&#8217;s a surprisingly boring story) just to see what his reaction would be to the internet. We know, it&#8217;s immature to dabble in necromancy, but we thought that we could get some funny reactions to him seeing all the Stepmom jokes and daddy memes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead, Sigmund managed to immediately find r/Frued and within an hour his account was banned from the subreddit. It all happened so suddenly, at first he was just insisting on using the phrase &#8216;Fehlleistungen&#8217; in every reply, and by the time we checked on him again he was using several slurs in an argument with user &#8216;darealfreud&#8217;. We tried to explain to the mod team that it was a different time back then, but they kept the ban up.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now he&#8217;s spent the past few hours just scrolling through pages of Google search results for &#8216;mothers&#8217;, somebody help us undo the ban please, soon he&#8217;s going to discover something he shouldn&#8217;t see and &#8211; wait hang on is that a 4chan page SIGMUND NO!&nbsp;</p>\n","title":"Help!

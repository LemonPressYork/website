No injuries were sustained on either side. A university representative stated following the encounter that, “Both sides fundamentally want to a peaceful conclusion to the aggressions for their people and realise they can’t get that without resolving the language barrier issues we now face”.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Geese representatives declined to comment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Luke Horwitz</em></p>\n","title":"University-Geese Ceasefire Off Following Peace Talks Communication Breakdown","date":"October 16, 2021","author":{"node":{"id":"dXNlcjox","avatar":{"url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/9efbc643bbcb6227dd47e272eb566de7?s=96&d=mm&r=g"},"description":"Articles from the past and present team at The Lemon Press!","firstName":"Lemon Press","lastName":"Writers"}},"featuredImage":{"node":{"altText":"","localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/11f70caed2b90626a76d29f47aa79fef/de8d1/geese-1990202_1920.jpg","srcSet":"/static/11f70caed2b90626a76d29f47aa79fef/92368/geese-1990202_1920.jpg 750w,\n/static/11f70caed2b90626a76d29f47aa79fef/8c915/geese-1990202_1920.jpg 1080w,\n/static/11f70caed2b90626a76d29f47aa79fef/479cb/geese-1990202_1920.jpg 1366w,\n/static/11f70caed2b90626a76d29f47aa79fef/de8d1/geese-1990202_1920.jpg 1920w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/11f70caed2b90626a76d29f47aa79fef/63b3a/geese-1990202_1920.avif 750w,\n/static/11f70caed2b90626a76d29f47aa79fef/dc34f/geese-1990202_1920.avif 1080w,\n/static/11f70caed2b90626a76d29f47aa79fef/df7d6/geese-1990202_1920.avif 1366w,\n/static/11f70caed2b90626a76d29f47aa79fef/797d7/geese-1990202_1920.avif 1920w","type":"image/avif","sizes":"100vw"},{"srcSet":"/static/11f70caed2b90626a76d29f47aa79fef/c5e11/geese-1990202_1920.webp 750w,\n/static/11f70caed2b90626a76d29f47aa79fef/c34ed/geese-1990202_1920.webp 1080w,\n/static/11f70caed2b90626a76d29f47aa79fef/c1bc7/geese-1990202_1920.webp 1366w,\n/static/11f70caed2b90626a76d29f47aa79fef/d85eb/geese-1990202_1920.webp 1920w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"100vw"}]},"width":1,"height":0.6666666666666666}}}}}},"previous":{"slug":"top-tips-for-campus-living-college-by-college","title":"Top Tips For Campus Living: College-by-College"},"next":{"slug":"dear-aunty-b-freshers-2021","title":"Dear Aunty B – Freshers 2021"}},"pageContext":{"id":"cG9zdDoxOTk=","previousPostId":"cG9zdDoyMDY=","nextPostId":"cG9zdDoxOTQ="}},

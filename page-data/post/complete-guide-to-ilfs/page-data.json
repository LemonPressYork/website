An entire nation jealous of a zimmer frame&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>DILF &#8211; Da’s, Dads and Daddies. These are three separate demographics, a Da is an older centrist, a Dad is just someone who has bred a child, and a Daddy can be anyone emitting dominant father energy. Please classify your D’s correctly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>FILF &#8211; Filthy people, if you can get past the grime you can have a great time!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>GILF &#8211; Controversially, this one is only reserved for Grandads. If we separate parents, why are we not separating grandparents? Seems rather ageist tbf.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>HILF &#8211; Hobbits. You all have one you find the most attractive, admit it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>JILF &#8211; Okay I swear there was an American spread called Jilf? Like I can see the label in my head and everything, have I gaslit myself into seeing a fictional spread? Anyway a Jilf is a fuckable John from Garfield.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>KILF &#8211; Could either refer to a serial killer or a man in a kilt, it’s up to you to figure out which one is more socially-acceptable.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>LILF &#8211; Lenny Leonard, a uniquely Sigma male man, is an example of a Lenny I would fuck.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>MILF &#8211; Miscellaneous, for both Mothers and any other category not caught by the list, because almost every category of person can have fuckable members! [We’ve never seen our legal team move so fast as when they put ‘almost’ in that sentence &#8211; Eds].&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>NILF &#8211; Nans! They finally have their own category, hooray!&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>PILF &#8211; An attractive person who has been ‘pilled’, whether that be red, blue or gamer!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>QILF &#8211; Queens, which again is a mindset rather than a title (whilst Girlbosses are determined by what the title-holder does, a Queen is determined by how others treat the title-holder).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>RILF &#8211; Anyone Scooby-Doo would find attractive.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>SILF &#8211; Slytherin, a term created exclusively for Malfoys, however J.K.Rowling recently revealed it was created in 1587 for the hung wizarding master Snekdicke McCumples.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>TILF &#8211; A term for hot Tories that should be classified as a slur, nobody should ever use that word, I’ve just been sick writing it. Eeeeeeeeeeeergh.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>VILF &#8211; Villain, we all like a baddie!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WILF &#8211; Wilfred Mott, what a breedable man, I’d like some of Bernard’s Cribbins please!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>XILF &#8211; Pirates I’d like to fuck, I wanna see what that hook can do to me!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>YILF &#8211; You! No, not actually you, it’s just while you were reading this I created this idea of you in my head, I would never actually do it as I have this perfect world in my imagination. You even found the joke about Scooby-Doo funny in it, it’s so lovely in here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>ZILF &#8211; Zero-chance, if there is someone who you would never ever do under any circumstances, they are pure ZILFs!</p>\n","title":"Complete Guide To ILFs","date":"January 13, 2022","author":{"node":{"id":"dXNlcjoy","avatar":{"url":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/2137597d6cf24feaef5ef618aeafdb5d?s=96&d=mm&r=g"},"description":"Editor of The Lemon Press, Hero to The Masses, Legend of The Streets","firstName":"Dan","lastName":"Saxotweet"}},"featuredImage":null},"previous":{"slug":"10-ways-to-decorate-your-student-house","title":"11 Ways To Decorate Your Student House"},"next":{"slug":"aunty-b-issue-50","title":"Aunty B – Issue 50"}},"pageContext":{"id":"cG9zdDoyNzM=","previousPostId":"cG9zdDoyNzY=","nextPostId":"cG9zdDoyNjg="}},

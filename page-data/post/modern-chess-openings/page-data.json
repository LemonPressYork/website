Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A classic opening, you can’t go too wrong with this one. Played by all the top-level players. Will hold you in good stead for the middle and endgames.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nimzo-Indian Defence</strong> [1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A solid and inoffensive opening. For players who are feeling suggestive and/or want to be slutted out by their opponent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Richter-Veresov Attack</strong> [1. d4 d5 2. Nc3 Nf6 3. Bg5]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the type of player who denies themselves base luxuries and owns an uneven number of shoes. Popular with creationists.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>King’s Shtandart Declined</strong> [1. h3 Na6 2. h4 Nb4 3. {resignation}]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fiery opening for players who only have a few minutes to spare between meetings wanting a quick game. Has been described as <em>“an affront to all I hold dear about chess.”</em> – Carlsen, 1996.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Maclaurin-Taylor</strong> [1. e3 followed by e2 ad infinitum]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Intense and divisive. Keep repeating the same two opening moves until either:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>your opponent collapses from exhaustion/sleep-deprivation,</li><li>the Earth is swallowed by the expanding Sun, or</li><li>your wrist gets a bit tired.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Suspension of Disbelief</strong> [1. N/A, but probably just the Ruy-Lopez, no one fucking plays any other fucking opening these days I swear to God] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Having already lost the game, inform your opponent that you had, in fact, won. Re-enforce and re-iterate <em>your </em>truth they are forced to believe you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Checkers</strong> [1. 9-14 23-18 2. 14&#215;23 27&#215;18 3. 5-9]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the players of chess who would rather not play chess right now and play checkers instead. Fun for the whole family.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Uncle Keith’s Opening</strong> [1. ???]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lovely Uncle Keith said he’d show you his opening if you behaved and promised to keep it a secret. Thus, I am sworn to secrecy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tell Them How You Feel</strong> [1. while reaching for e4, instead slowly caress their left hand with your right index finger]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remind your opponent of the impact they’ve made on your life, and that, through it all, you will remain true to them until the end (of the game).</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cholis Ketteridge’s Third Great Thimbleseizure</strong> [grab the king-side bishop and ram it into your right temple with enough force to cause immediate brain death]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>An oft forgotten rule; if a player dies during a chess game, the result is an immediate draw. For the sort of player who’s looking to draw the game without looking like a pussy bitch by offering one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Adam Berry</em></p>\n","title":"Modern Chess Openings","date":"July 08, 2022","author":{"node":{"id":"dXNlcjox","avatar":{"url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/9efbc643bbcb6227dd47e272eb566de7?s=96&d=mm&r=g"},"description":"Articles from the past and present team at The Lemon Press!","firstName":"Lemon Press","lastName":"Writers"}},"featuredImage":{"node":{"altText":"","localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/6f7ed509011ce76a608949eac2d2a6ac/d28b9/chess-g5c565c8e7_1920.jpg","srcSet":"/static/6f7ed509011ce76a608949eac2d2a6ac/490b1/chess-g5c565c8e7_1920.jpg 750w,\n/static/6f7ed509011ce76a608949eac2d2a6ac/5817f/chess-g5c565c8e7_1920.jpg 1080w,\n/static/6f7ed509011ce76a608949eac2d2a6ac/e81bf/chess-g5c565c8e7_1920.jpg 1366w,\n/static/6f7ed509011ce76a608949eac2d2a6ac/d28b9/chess-g5c565c8e7_1920.jpg 1920w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/6f7ed509011ce76a608949eac2d2a6ac/c4056/chess-g5c565c8e7_1920.avif 750w,\n/static/6f7ed509011ce76a608949eac2d2a6ac/95d25/chess-g5c565c8e7_1920.avif 1080w,\n/static/6f7ed509011ce76a608949eac2d2a6ac/f2d65/chess-g5c565c8e7_1920.avif 1366w,\n/static/6f7ed509011ce76a608949eac2d2a6ac/c4df6/chess-g5c565c8e7_1920.avif 1920w","type":"image/avif","sizes":"100vw"},{"srcSet":"/static/6f7ed509011ce76a608949eac2d2a6ac/1da0e/chess-g5c565c8e7_1920.webp 750w,\n/static/6f7ed509011ce76a608949eac2d2a6ac/3c544/chess-g5c565c8e7_1920.webp 1080w,\n/static/6f7ed509011ce76a608949eac2d2a6ac/868fe/chess-g5c565c8e7_1920.webp 1366w,\n/static/6f7ed509011ce76a608949eac2d2a6ac/15a8f/chess-g5c565c8e7_1920.webp 1920w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"100vw"}]},"width":1,"height":0.525}}}}}},"previous":{"slug":"the-most-ironic-sports-stars-middle-names","title":"The Most Ironic Sports Stars’ Middle Names"},"next":{"slug":"reasons-i-can-fix-the-biggest-worm-from-dune","title":"Reasons I Can Fix The Biggest Worm From ‘Dune’ "}},"pageContext":{"id":"cG9zdDo0MDI=","previousPostId":"cG9zdDo0MDc=","nextPostId":"cG9zdDozOTc="}},

Intelligence analysts predict that the taskforce’s capabilities will include delivering love letters and blaring decadent western music at a range of approximately 2-10 feet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Potentially, this will provide medium range surveillance if they manage to tape a GoPro to one of the landing struts. YUSU led the international community in placing sanctions on ISIS at the start of term by banning them from all campus bars, charging an extra 20% for all merchandise, and revoking their free Unibus privileges. However, the campus Nisa has resisted pressure to levy sanctions and continues trade with the militant group, offering essential supplies such as Pot Noodles for the low price of £9.50.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Discussions are now underway regarding the possibility of training opposing milita forces to ISIS. HAZSoc is already developed an intensive course to bring Iraqi Irregulars up to speed on modern tactics such as ‘not running away’ and ‘shooting a bit’. Meanwhile, the Model UN Association is reviewing their options, though analysts predict that aside from a stern telling off, they will again be doing bugger all for the foreseeable future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When pressed for comment by intrepid Lemon Press student journo scum Randy Moleskin, ISIS officials claimed to be untroubled by the proposed intervention, asking: ‘What is YUSU?’ and ‘You do realise we&#8217;re going to behead you now?’</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ben Walker, issue 22, 2014</em></p>\n","title":"The Fight Against ISIS ‒ YUSU Pledges Military Support","date":"April 06, 2015","author":{"node":{"id":"dXNlcjox","avatar":{"url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/9efbc643bbcb6227dd47e272eb566de7?s=96&d=mm&r=g"},"description":"Articles from the past and present team at The Lemon Press!","firstName":"Lemon Press","lastName":"Writers"}},"featuredImage":{"node":{"altText":"","localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/25fefea0894223f62d4b8e7a77457038/9c509/soldiers-1002_1920.jpg","srcSet":"/static/25fefea0894223f62d4b8e7a77457038/e79df/soldiers-1002_1920.jpg 750w,\n/static/25fefea0894223f62d4b8e7a77457038/ad4fa/soldiers-1002_1920.jpg 1080w,\n/static/25fefea0894223f62d4b8e7a77457038/df20c/soldiers-1002_1920.jpg 1366w,\n/static/25fefea0894223f62d4b8e7a77457038/9c509/soldiers-1002_1920.jpg 1920w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/25fefea0894223f62d4b8e7a77457038/82053/soldiers-1002_1920.avif 750w,\n/static/25fefea0894223f62d4b8e7a77457038/5acb7/soldiers-1002_1920.avif 1080w,\n/static/25fefea0894223f62d4b8e7a77457038/c10e3/soldiers-1002_1920.avif 1366w,\n/static/25fefea0894223f62d4b8e7a77457038/3005f/soldiers-1002_1920.avif 1920w","type":"image/avif","sizes":"100vw"},{"srcSet":"/static/25fefea0894223f62d4b8e7a77457038/62b9c/soldiers-1002_1920.webp 750w,\n/static/25fefea0894223f62d4b8e7a77457038/061fb/soldiers-1002_1920.webp 1080w,\n/static/25fefea0894223f62d4b8e7a77457038/44769/soldiers-1002_1920.webp 1366w,\n/static/25fefea0894223f62d4b8e7a77457038/297ff/soldiers-1002_1920.webp 1920w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"100vw"}]},"width":1,"height":0.6015625}}}}}},"previous":{"slug":"yusu-find-new-and-exciting-ways-to-achieve-nothing","title":"YUSU Find New and Exciting Ways to Achieve Nothing"},"next":{"slug":"yusu-working-hard-to-create-a-better-university-for-after-youve-gone","title":"YUSU Working Hard to Create a Better University for After You’ve Gone"}},"pageContext":{"id":"cG9zdDoxNTE=","previousPostId":"cG9zdDoxMTg=","nextPostId":"cG9zdDoxNTY="}},

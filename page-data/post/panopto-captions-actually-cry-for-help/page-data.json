The service, just assumed to be using a standard auto-captioning system that wasn’t<br>particularly fit for the purpose of online learning or assisting the hearing impaired, was in fact employing several dudes to write their<br>subtitles at the start of the pandemic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘It started off with 6 of us’ said the anonymous man, recently freed from his shackles. ‘Sure we were taken off the street and forced to<br>watch hundreds of hours of lectures, but we had a nice little team down there. We got along well, but all good things must come to an<br>end, and one by one we turned on each other. Bobby the Dazzler had been given the politics and economics lectures and over time<br>just became the most insufferable shit going, we took the decision to all strangle him in his sleep, ‘et tu Bobby’ style. Desmond<br>appreciated that reference, ot because he did the history lectures, but because he did the Interactive Media ones and so had a load of<br>free time on his hands to look at history videos. He eventually died after we were permitted a once-a-year movie night and he started<br>giving opinions on what film we should watch. Even in his last breath he was still demanding we watch Tenet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Next was Steve the STEM boy. Did you know physics is just applied maths? Did you know chemistry is just applied physics? Did you<br>know biology is just applied chemistry? Steve did! Oh fuck Steve did. He was wielding the stem knowledge like some form of<br>Quadrisci Infinity Gauntlet, he was a 50 year old construction worker who was about to discover reddit for the first time before we<br>finished him off. A mercy killing really.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Of course, all the captions had to be done, so we were given more work to do and mistakes eventually crept in. A typo here, a “their”<br>instead of “they’re” there, all understandable mistakes when you’re doing two at 4x speed simultaneously. The other two died from<br>the stress alone, which was inconvenient as I hadn’t eaten the meat off the others yet. But as our overlords seemed not to do<br>anything to correct the typos, I tested the water. Swear words, profanity, still nobody came to punish me. So for the past year I have<br>been littering it with clues in hope somebody would find me.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The anonymous man&#8217;s capture was discovered by final year Maths student Gwenyth Bytheway. &#8216;I was watching and suddenly the<br>caption said the cosine of theta times i was inversely proportional to the sum of gamma over log n, when instead it as clearly directly<br>poroprtional. There&#8217;s no way a system would make such a blunder unless they were actualy a person putting clues in for help!&#8217; said<br>Gwenyth, who missed the first three minutes of continuous &#8216;HELP ME I AM LOCKED IN A BASEMENT UNDER FLARES&#8217; as &#8216;everyone<br>skips those bits anyway.&#8217;</p>\n","title":"Panopto Captions Actually Cry For Help","date":"July 08, 2022","author":{"node":{"id":"dXNlcjoy","avatar":{"url":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/2137597d6cf24feaef5ef618aeafdb5d?s=96&d=mm&r=g"},"description":"Editor of The Lemon Press, Hero to The Masses, Legend of The Streets","firstName":"Dan","lastName":"Saxotweet"}},"featuredImage":{"node":{"altText":"","localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/274a80d8e35070b2ecb72aa4a19bdf12/de8d1/pexels-pixabay-162389-1-scaled.jpg","srcSet":"/static/274a80d8e35070b2ecb72aa4a19bdf12/92368/pexels-pixabay-162389-1-scaled.jpg 750w,\n/static/274a80d8e35070b2ecb72aa4a19bdf12/8c915/pexels-pixabay-162389-1-scaled.jpg 1080w,\n/static/274a80d8e35070b2ecb72aa4a19bdf12/479cb/pexels-pixabay-162389-1-scaled.jpg 1366w,\n/static/274a80d8e35070b2ecb72aa4a19bdf12/de8d1/pexels-pixabay-162389-1-scaled.jpg 1920w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/274a80d8e35070b2ecb72aa4a19bdf12/63b3a/pexels-pixabay-162389-1-scaled.avif 750w,\n/static/274a80d8e35070b2ecb72aa4a19bdf12/dc34f/pexels-pixabay-162389-1-scaled.avif 1080w,\n/static/274a80d8e35070b2ecb72aa4a19bdf12/df7d6/pexels-pixabay-162389-1-scaled.avif 1366w,\n/static/274a80d8e35070b2ecb72aa4a19bdf12/797d7/pexels-pixabay-162389-1-scaled.avif 1920w","type":"image/avif","sizes":"100vw"},{"srcSet":"/static/274a80d8e35070b2ecb72aa4a19bdf12/c5e11/pexels-pixabay-162389-1-scaled.webp 750w,\n/static/274a80d8e35070b2ecb72aa4a19bdf12/c34ed/pexels-pixabay-162389-1-scaled.webp 1080w,\n/static/274a80d8e35070b2ecb72aa4a19bdf12/c1bc7/pexels-pixabay-162389-1-scaled.webp 1366w,\n/static/274a80d8e35070b2ecb72aa4a19bdf12/d85eb/pexels-pixabay-162389-1-scaled.webp 1920w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"100vw"}]},"width":1,"height":0.6666666666666666}}}}}},"previous":{"slug":"captain-tom-foundation-closing-down-sale","title":"Captain Tom Foundation Closing Down Sale"},"next":{"slug":"york-tories-accidently-host-fox-bunting-social","title":"York Tories Accidently Host Fox Bunting Social"}},"pageContext":{"id":"cG9zdDozNTE=","previousPostId":"cG9zdDozNTg=","nextPostId":"cG9zdDozNDU="}},

Now we’ll only have three more sensual overloads of albums before Martin finishes. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Following the release of Fix You, hospitals were inundated with new babies nine months later. Hearing that the band’s hospital-busting days are nearing their end, fans are despondent. Scientists are already predicting the birth rate will take a pounding as a post-Martin malaise hits middle England’s shores. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A lifelong fan told us, ‘Martin’s got staying power and his music gives me that too.’ Coldplay is like viagra for middle-aged middle class businessman, essentially it is viagra.

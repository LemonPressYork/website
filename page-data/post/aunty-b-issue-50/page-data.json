However, it&#8217;s not your friends&#8217; singleness that&#8217;s the problem, it&#8217;s you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You&#8217;ve found yourself a partner, and now you&#8217;ve become sad and boring, and instead of letting your friends, still wild and free, enjoy themselves, you want to drag them down into your hole of domesticity with you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You have two options, submit to your monotonous life and watch your friends live their much more fun and interesting life and support them from the sidelines, or ditch your partner and return to the far more exciting world of sloppy hookups and drunk texts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>I&#8217;ve had freshers’ flu for over a month! How do I get rid of it?</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Freshers’ Flu™ is a conspiracy created by Big Pharma to sell more Lemsips. They’ve been putting toxic chemicals in the cheapest instant ramen for decades. Unfortunately, even if you do wake up and stop being a SHEEP, on a student budget you can’t really afford not to eat that cheap ramen. However, luckily for you, I was recently forwarded an antidote on whatsapp. Simply, mix some nutmeg into a pint of cum (home-made is best but store bought is fine)&nbsp; and chug it &#8211; this should counteract the effects of the toxins and get you back to full health in 3-5 business days.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n","title":"Aunty B – Issue 50","date":"January 13, 2022","author":{"node":{"id":"dXNlcjox","avatar":{"url":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/9efbc643bbcb6227dd47e272eb566de7?s=96&d=mm&r=g"},"description":"Articles from the past and present team at The Lemon Press!","firstName":"Lemon Press","lastName":"Writers"}},"featuredImage":{"node":{"altText":"","localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAAFCAIAAADKYVtkAAAACXBIWXMAAAsTAAALEwEAmpwYAAABBElEQVQY001PPWvCUADMn3XyLwiCg4ubg4NOQkBwUBRUFDVSFImxmocxiEobTJO00RhiayUf712xAdvjuOHguDvOGo1eazVbknzXBQDG7kIpAFMQTEHALyLf17tdGgQAgstlkcnonQ63KRbt2cxdr7VG47RYnFcrWxS/LQuAlEop+fxZUc6q6hCiFgqOLPuuy8LwKZHQ6nXOIcQWRWMw2PP8vlLZ8fyh1QLgEPKcTm9KpZdq1RgOj5L01utNksnjfH41TZLLGf0+d1ouP6bT6HZ7bI418Lz38fhqGI8Xn5omZ7MAvO12Vy5/6ToXX7oHGGOUxvwzKWVRRMMQwKHd1prN/x0/e9EFafPDgEoAAAAASUVORK5CYII="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/460f2369b242bbdce6c8b8e6e5fdd68d/a5c39/unnamed-7.png","srcSet":"/static/460f2369b242bbdce6c8b8e6e5fdd68d/a5c39/unnamed-7.png 512w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/460f2369b242bbdce6c8b8e6e5fdd68d/7002f/unnamed-7.avif 512w","type":"image/avif","sizes":"100vw"},{"srcSet":"/static/460f2369b242bbdce6c8b8e6e5fdd68d/6db3c/unnamed-7.webp 512w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"100vw"}]},"width":1,"height":0.259765625}}}}}},"previous":{"slug":"complete-guide-to-ilfs","title":"Complete Guide To ILFs"},"next":{"slug":"best-places-to-lose-your-virginity-around-york","title":"Best Places To Lose Your Virginity Around York"}},"pageContext":{"id":"cG9zdDoyNjg=","previousPostId":"cG9zdDoyNzM=","nextPostId":"cG9zdDoyNjM="}},

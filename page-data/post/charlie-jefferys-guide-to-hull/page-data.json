We are grateful for your continued support and lack of a coordinated campaign for tuition fee refunds throughout last year, and we cannot wait to have you back.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like any university we are still facing some challenges as a result of the last 18 months, however, we have kept up our tradition of dealing with these in uniquely batshit-weird ways. To the students currently settling into their new homes in Hull, I say that I know this is not the start of the year that many of you may have signed up for, unless you are looking at this from a contractual standpoint, in which case we insist this is the start of the year that you signed up for.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, living in Hull is still a fantastic experience, so fantastic that we have generously given back to you 10% of your rent so that you have more income to spend at the many attractions and amusements in Hull. I have personally spent a lot of time in Hull, me and my family make trips to Hull every weekend to enjoy the culture and people there. I wanted to take this opportunity to share my own favorite places in Hull, to show you why you should be grateful we have let you live in such a wonderful city.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If I had to pick a favorite place, it would be The Deep. The Deep is a public aquarium situated at Sammy&#8217;s Point, at the confluence of the River Hull and the Humber Estuary in Hull, England. It opened in March 2002. Billed as &#8220;the world&#8217;s only submarium&#8221;,[4] the exhibits contain thousands of sea creatures (including seven species of shark), 2,500,000 litres (550,000 imp gal; 660,000 US gal) of water and 87 tonnes (96 short tons; 86 long tons) of salt housed in a building designed by Sir Terry Farrell and built as part of the UK National Lottery&#8217;s Millennium Commission project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Me and my family have also spent many happy days on The Humber Bridge, near Kingston upon Hull, East Riding of Yorkshire, England, is a 2.22 km (2,430 yd; 7,300 ft; 1.38 mi) single-span road suspension bridge, which opened to traffic on 24 June 1981. When it opened, the bridge was the longest of its type in the world; it was not surpassed until 1998, with the completion of the Akashi Kaikyō Bridge, and is now the eleventh-longest. It is still the second-longest span in the Western Hemisphere.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And finally, what trip to Hull would be complete without seeing the Hull Minister, where you can see all of the Hull St John students enjoying their hard-earned graduations. You never see the University of Hull students complaining about that, do you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that concludes my guide to Hull. I look forward to once again seeing you all, in my newspaper, complaining about one scandal or another like the ungrateful children that you are.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Best wishes</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Charlie.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><br>As told to Daniel Bennett&nbsp;</p>\n","title":"Charlie Jeffery’s Guide To Hull","date":"October 07, 2021","author":{"node":{"id":"dXNlcjoy","avatar":{"url":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/2137597d6cf24feaef5ef618aeafdb5d?s=96&d=mm&r=g"},"description":"Editor of The Lemon Press, Hero to The Masses, Legend of The Streets","firstName":"Dan","lastName":"Saxotweet"}},"featuredImage":{"node":{"altText":"","localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/2wBDAAEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQH/2wBDAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQH/wgARCAAHABQDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFgABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAcI/8QAFgEBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAMF/9oADAMBAAIQAxAAAAGx53I6dWDAf//EABgQAAMBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIFBgMH/9oACAEBAAEFApXRoqmQuFoKt+dRZa//xAAeEQACAgICAwAAAAAAAAAAAAABAgMREiIQEyExMv/aAAgBAwEBPwHJoe9EOoimjohTq00eR+fDN7LCjd1V8f/EAB4RAAEDBQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAECAxEAEiExMgQT/9oACAECAQE/AR5ml/J1STeoNOdr2W0GInlMC0GcYqBuBX//xAAgEAADAAIBBAMAAAAAAAAAAAABAgMEBREAEyExBhIy/9oACAEBAAY/AqWyvjmQZQhmEPTb62nMVyd7WtZoodk4GYVZWYu9Zu6+HXrQ5FddZsJ6rqn7ZiGIMcZEzGQp9nUcBOwahlBNFb2hZ20GvoW4Jaq2q3oD9UqzccDwOev/xAAXEAEBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABEQAx/9oACAEBAAE/IbFRosY8jmik6Xe7fQMhLZE5qodXcCExHiOwV3//2gAMAwEAAgADAAAAEH/v/8QAGhEBAAIDAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAREhADFR8P/aAAgBAwEBPxADXNHIVkJSCCTCEgAAg0arlRXuZ//EABsRAQEBAAIDAAAAAAAAAAAAAAERIQAxUWGx/9oACAECAQE/ELcU7ACgxYAIFKLb6oxcO8fHr7z/xAAXEAEBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABEQAh/9oACAEBAAE/EBUTwCL6JEmnrfn9OqjbwbXW9mK8UbIsDvV//9k="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/f3a9c6f00a1723dab401f4d96a5dfb8a/0de55/charlie-jeffery-e1634147310602.jpg","srcSet":"/static/f3a9c6f00a1723dab401f4d96a5dfb8a/5ce54/charlie-jeffery-e1634147310602.jpg 750w,\n/static/f3a9c6f00a1723dab401f4d96a5dfb8a/42464/charlie-jeffery-e1634147310602.jpg 1080w,\n/static/f3a9c6f00a1723dab401f4d96a5dfb8a/335c7/charlie-jeffery-e1634147310602.jpg 1366w,\n/static/f3a9c6f00a1723dab401f4d96a5dfb8a/0de55/charlie-jeffery-e1634147310602.jpg 1920w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/f3a9c6f00a1723dab401f4d96a5dfb8a/aa82e/charlie-jeffery-e1634147310602.avif 750w,\n/static/f3a9c6f00a1723dab401f4d96a5dfb8a/1845c/charlie-jeffery-e1634147310602.avif 1080w,\n/static/f3a9c6f00a1723dab401f4d96a5dfb8a/1aacc/charlie-jeffery-e1634147310602.avif 1366w,\n/static/f3a9c6f00a1723dab401f4d96a5dfb8a/1af80/charlie-jeffery-e1634147310602.avif 1920w","type":"image/avif","sizes":"100vw"},{"srcSet":"/static/f3a9c6f00a1723dab401f4d96a5dfb8a/9a7cf/charlie-jeffery-e1634147310602.webp 750w,\n/static/f3a9c6f00a1723dab401f4d96a5dfb8a/73b00/charlie-jeffery-e1634147310602.webp 1080w,\n/static/f3a9c6f00a1723dab401f4d96a5dfb8a/8da8e/charlie-jeffery-e1634147310602.webp 1366w,\n/static/f3a9c6f00a1723dab401f4d96a5dfb8a/e9a08/charlie-jeffery-e1634147310602.webp 1920w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"100vw"}]},"width":1,"height":0.34218750000000003}}}}}},"previous":{"slug":"men-i-can-fix","title":"Men I Can Fix"},"next":{"slug":"the-himbos-journey","title":"The Himbos Journey "}},"pageContext":{"id":"cG9zdDo3OA==","previousPostId":"cG9zdDo4Mw==","nextPostId":"cG9zdDo2Nw=="}},

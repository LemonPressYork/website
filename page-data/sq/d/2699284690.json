My thoughts are only with those who are suffering most due to this. No, not his unspecified number of children, or those who have suffered as a result of the countless scandals that 50+ government officials suddenly chose to remember this week, but the new Sabbatical Officers who posted their introductory posts just as the UK started exploding this month. I’ve dug through what we already know about these new trusty trustees to find out who they are endorsing to be the new leader of the Tories. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Pierrick &#8211; Rory Stewart </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pierrick has done nothing as President yet, I am already a huge fan. He has already had the character-building moment of being left on read by Charlie Jeffrey during his time as the Environment and Ethics Officer for the UK’s 93rd-most sustainable University, so he already carries more cynicism than even the most hungover version of POD ever had. While I am sure that becoming further submerged in the middle-managing bureaucracy of YUSU will not cause further strife and definitely won’t turn him into the fucking Joker, there is a chance that he could become York’s very own Rory Stewart: a sensible voice in a sea of madness who steps away from the ladder of power after seizing the hearts of the people, before starting a podcast with an accused war criminal (try to catch one at the next<em> Nouse</em> Alumni event).</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Deb &#8211; Matt Hancock</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the five years that I have been at this University, Deb is the Sabbatical Officer I am most convinced that I could approach at a party and sell an NFT to (yes I considered the OTHER obvious candidate, but Deb edged it as he does not yet give the impression that he would stab me on sight for being a part of student media.) And the current flagbearer of crypto in the Tory party is, genuinely, Matt Hancock. Deb and Matt The Shagger are kindred spirits, being outdoor adventurers with UNORTHODOX policies regarding people with disabilities and a burning desire to spend a fortune on digital services of questionable usefulness! We should do everything in our power to get Matt and Deb in the same room, then sell the resultant footage to either Netflix or the FBI. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Franki &#8211; Boris Johnson</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>For all his many, many, many flaws, Boris Johnson is the only Prime Minister who has ever given off the vibe that he would care about Roses, which is in all honesty a worse crime than causing 180,000 COVID-19 deaths. Think about it; a weekend of intense sports between the mostly-privately-educated, for glory that’s based on a historic squabble? All that’s needed now is comfier sleeping arrangements to allow for mass-impregnation orgies and our caretaker PM would volunteer to fund the tournament personally! </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Rohan &#8211; Nadine Dorries</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the former ComedySoc chair, Rohan must endorse the banter candidate; and who else would be funnier than Boris’s political widow, Nadine Dorries? Who could forget that time she did a TikTok rap (#Cringe)! Or that time she said online films were ‘downstreamed’ (she blamed dyslexia, what’s more comedic than a member of a disability-hostile government facing hostility due to a disability! Bantz)! Or her entire voting record (we keep making jokes about her and she keeps on getting away with making awful political decisions without losing standing in her own party! What now? Does the solution involve more jokes?)</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Hannah &#8211; Liz Truss</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you have any idea how excruciating it is to write satire about Community and Wellbeing Officers? So often they serve scandal-and-quirk-free tenures, and I would sooner publish my home address than any satire about most of the high-profile topics they deal with. The only good Community and Officer content was Effy’s #Bustice saga (a petition campaign that fixed the First Bus problem as effectively as that one digger fixed the Suez Canal problem), so any CAWO must naturally gravitate towards an MP who has had one singular funny moment. So step forwards Liz ‘Cheese and Pork Markets’ Truss, please collect your Sabbatical Officer endorsement and pray that the student-run activism pages don&#8217;t choose someone else instead.</p>\n","categories":{"nodes":[{"name":"Campus","slug":"campus"}]},"featuredImage":{"node":{"id":"cG9zdDo0MTU=","localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"id":"b0ce9918-aa51-5d77-a4f3-b11e1e3863d1","gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/png;base64,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"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/37f9542c118d18fffb2e1a94ddec3d5e/8a271/5_new_sabbs_edited-1536x1152-1.png","srcSet":"/static/37f9542c118d18fffb2e1a94ddec3d5e/b1958/5_new_sabbs_edited-1536x1152-1.png 384w,\n/static/37f9542c118d18fffb2e1a94ddec3d5e/569c7/5_new_sabbs_edited-1536x1152-1.png 768w,\n/static/37f9542c118d18fffb2e1a94ddec3d5e/8a271/5_new_sabbs_edited-1536x1152-1.png 1536w","sizes":"(min-width: 1536px) 1536px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/37f9542c118d18fffb2e1a94ddec3d5e/455fe/5_new_sabbs_edited-1536x1152-1.avif 384w,\n/static/37f9542c118d18fffb2e1a94ddec3d5e/f1859/5_new_sabbs_edited-1536x1152-1.avif 768w,\n/static/37f9542c118d18fffb2e1a94ddec3d5e/0df09/5_new_sabbs_edited-1536x1152-1.avif 1536w","type":"image/avif","sizes":"(min-width: 1536px) 1536px, 100vw"},{"srcSet":"/static/37f9542c118d18fffb2e1a94ddec3d5e/aad4b/5_new_sabbs_edited-1536x1152-1.webp 384w,\n/static/37f9542c118d18fffb2e1a94ddec3d5e/41f06/5_new_sabbs_edited-1536x1152-1.webp 768w,\n/static/37f9542c118d18fffb2e1a94ddec3d5e/95e44/5_new_sabbs_edited-1536x1152-1.webp 1536w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1536px) 1536px, 100vw"}]},"width":1536,"height":1152}}}}}}},{"node":{"title":"The Most Ironic Sports Stars’ Middle Names","slug":"the-most-ironic-sports-stars-middle-names","content":"\n<p><strong>Kurt Happy Zouma &#8211; </strong>The average centre-back and professional foot-cat player, Kurt Zouma’s recent, umm, “incident” is made much funnier by the fact that his actual middle name at birth was “Happy”. Something that poor cat probably wasn’t. It does also make him potentially the perfect person to cast in the upcoming live-action “Snow White” movie, despite his 6’3 stature.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Novak Astra Djokovic &#8211;</strong> Tennis’s newest bad boy and one of the greatest players of all time, the Serb’s recent deportation from Australia is made interesting by the fact that he was born Novak Astra Djokovic &#8211; with Astra both referring to the Latin word for “the stars”, and one of the predecessors of probably his least favourite pharmaceutical company. Probably. We’ll never know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bobby de Gea Quintana &#8211;</strong> The Spanish goalkeeping maestro made headlines shortly following his transfer to Manchester United after he was reported to have stolen a Krispy Kreme from a Tesco in Altrincham back in 2011. No further action was taken against the then-20-year-old, although it is still funny that the lad’s middle name seemed to foreshadow his dealings with the law as a young adult living in England.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Michael Lewis Masi &#8211;</strong> While not strictly a “sports star” per se, Formula One’s race director and public enemy number one is still worthy of a mention, given that his middle name is, surprisingly, Lewis. Could it be that he intentionally caused the other, actually talented Lewis to lose the 2021 Formula One World Drivers’ Championship so as to deflect accusations of favouritism towards a driver with the same name? Probably not, but it makes you wonder. (I’m legally obliged to mention that we at The Lemon Press are not suggesting that Michael Masi is corrupt. Much.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Eldrick Tont Hammond “Tiger” Woods &#8211;</strong> that one was a mouthful. Tiger is known for two things &#8211; his golfing ability and his driving ability. One of them is very good, and one of them is very poor, just like his namesake &#8211; former Top Gear presenter and human crash test dummy Richard Hammond. Although, in fairness, with Richard’s recent appearances on  the fairway, maybe the two are total opposites? No, of course not, so long as they both possess the title of Sir Crashalot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ronnie Young</em></p>\n","categories":{"nodes":[{"name":"Sports","slug":"sports"}]},"featuredImage":{"node":{"id":"cG9zdDo0MDg=","localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"id":"4ae1f6c3-169e-593d-a80a-26c768b5cdc8","gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/2wBDABALDA4MChAODQ4SERATGCgaGBYWGDEjJR0oOjM9PDkzODdASFxOQERXRTc4UG1RV19iZ2hnPk1xeXBkeFxlZ2P/2wBDARESEhgVGC8aGi9jQjhCY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2P/wgARCAANABQDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAGAAAAwEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEEAgP/xAAWAQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQL/2gAMAwEAAhADEAAAAZVVpjgIX//EABoQAAMAAwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAhESITH/2gAIAQEAAQUCkctXOtLBfnEf/8QAFREBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACH/2gAIAQMBAT8BR//EABQRAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABD/2gAIAQIBAT8BP//EABoQAAICAwAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABEBESMlH/2gAIAQEABj8CNsuFt1DKSP/EABoQAQEBAQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAERACExQWH/2gAIAQEAAT8hJe0T8u5IU+DHsC+YBx7NEZ8mioIO/9oADAMBAAIAAwAAABAb3//EABgRAQEAAwAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEAESEx/9oACAEDAQE/EDkOGy//xAAXEQEBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAEFh/9oACAECAQE/EBDJ5f/EABwQAQEAAgIDAAAAAAAAAAAAAAERACExUXGBwf/aAAgBAQABPxCUlAbIncxOBipo3fr5mwsW0785UAGhesKlgpBxgFuA1n//2Q=="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/505d8e809b29f2ef48f13a499df1dadd/f0d12/pexels-oliver-sjostrom-1103833.jpg","srcSet":"/static/505d8e809b29f2ef48f13a499df1dadd/7fcca/pexels-oliver-sjostrom-1103833.jpg 1021w,\n/static/505d8e809b29f2ef48f13a499df1dadd/3d17a/pexels-oliver-sjostrom-1103833.jpg 2041w,\n/static/505d8e809b29f2ef48f13a499df1dadd/f0d12/pexels-oliver-sjostrom-1103833.jpg 4082w","sizes":"(min-width: 4082px) 4082px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/505d8e809b29f2ef48f13a499df1dadd/21374/pexels-oliver-sjostrom-1103833.avif 1021w,\n/static/505d8e809b29f2ef48f13a499df1dadd/a08a1/pexels-oliver-sjostrom-1103833.avif 2041w,\n/static/505d8e809b29f2ef48f13a499df1dadd/6bb94/pexels-oliver-sjostrom-1103833.avif 4082w","type":"image/avif","sizes":"(min-width: 4082px) 4082px, 100vw"},{"srcSet":"/static/505d8e809b29f2ef48f13a499df1dadd/cbee7/pexels-oliver-sjostrom-1103833.webp 1021w,\n/static/505d8e809b29f2ef48f13a499df1dadd/ed5e7/pexels-oliver-sjostrom-1103833.webp 2041w,\n/static/505d8e809b29f2ef48f13a499df1dadd/aa913/pexels-oliver-sjostrom-1103833.webp 4082w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 4082px) 4082px, 100vw"}]},"width":4082,"height":2721}}}}}}},{"node":{"title":"Modern Chess Openings","slug":"modern-chess-openings","content":"\n<p><strong>Ruy Lopez</strong> [1. e4 e5 2.

He&#8217;s a silent, borderline-Lovecraftian force of nature, but like so many damaged people I believe he is just one caring ear and tender embrace away from being fixed. I can fix him, and here&#8217;s the reasons why.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>1 &#8211; I too am opposed by capitalism and understand his anger towards the industrial complex. Not all of the worms attitudes have to be changed, I just have to get him to attack the system in less environmentally-catastrophic ways, like lobbying, or starting a podcast. I can change him, unless he just hates the miners in a Thatcher way, in which case I do also have a good track record of fixing Tories (albeit there will be less sexual tension on my part.)&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>2 &#8211; There&#8217;s probably even bigger worms. You haven&#8217;t seen them, but there&#8217;s a whole worm community going on down there where there&#8217;s probably a load of bigger worms making fun of him. But to me he&#8217;s a big boy, I would let him be the big spoon and get all the protector role vibes his brushed ego needs.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>3 &#8211; I would also let him be the little spoon. Half of that angry energy probably comes from him feeling like he has to be in the aggressor role to fit into society, but my wormy dude doesn&#8217;t have to live up to that role all the time. I&#8217;m not exactly sure how I could be the big spoon to a several-kilometer wide worm, other than clinging onto him like a dissapoined nit on a bald man, but just knowing there is someone ready to wrap their arms around him and tell him it&#8217;s all going to be okay should calm my big boy down.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>4 &#8211; Massive mouth hole. Huge. Multi-layered. Sucking. I don&#8217;t need to think about how to give that worm reassurance, I&#8217;ll just let that sandwussy get to work and let him measure how much I value him by the gallon.</p>\n","categories":{"nodes":[{"name":"Arts","slug":"arts"}]},"featuredImage":{"node":{"id":"cG9zdDozOTg=","localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"id":"e8476631-ed6a-5402-b9cc-21981ccc54bf","gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/756267cb946466052e800a3def6c74f2/fcb2f/30eda44c-688f-4b44-a53b-fd00a43373a6-6c2d7b27-78ad-4aa6-8250-822ae92e5d8a-new-sandworm-dune-copy.jpg","srcSet":"/static/756267cb946466052e800a3def6c74f2/f1930/30eda44c-688f-4b44-a53b-fd00a43373a6-6c2d7b27-78ad-4aa6-8250-822ae92e5d8a-new-sandworm-dune-copy.jpg 300w,\n/static/756267cb946466052e800a3def6c74f2/550ca/30eda44c-688f-4b44-a53b-fd00a43373a6-6c2d7b27-78ad-4aa6-8250-822ae92e5d8a-new-sandworm-dune-copy.jpg 600w,\n/static/756267cb946466052e800a3def6c74f2/fcb2f/30eda44c-688f-4b44-a53b-fd00a43373a6-6c2d7b27-78ad-4aa6-8250-822ae92e5d8a-new-sandworm-dune-copy.jpg 1200w","sizes":"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/756267cb946466052e800a3def6c74f2/355a9/30eda44c-688f-4b44-a53b-fd00a43373a6-6c2d7b27-78ad-4aa6-8250-822ae92e5d8a-new-sandworm-dune-copy.avif 300w,\n/static/756267cb946466052e800a3def6c74f2/1260c/30eda44c-688f-4b44-a53b-fd00a43373a6-6c2d7b27-78ad-4aa6-8250-822ae92e5d8a-new-sandworm-dune-copy.avif 600w,\n/static/756267cb946466052e800a3def6c74f2/30577/30eda44c-688f-4b44-a53b-fd00a43373a6-6c2d7b27-78ad-4aa6-8250-822ae92e5d8a-new-sandworm-dune-copy.avif 1200w","type":"image/avif","sizes":"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px, 100vw"},{"srcSet":"/static/756267cb946466052e800a3def6c74f2/c7da1/30eda44c-688f-4b44-a53b-fd00a43373a6-6c2d7b27-78ad-4aa6-8250-822ae92e5d8a-new-sandworm-dune-copy.webp 300w,\n/static/756267cb946466052e800a3def6c74f2/22c65/30eda44c-688f-4b44-a53b-fd00a43373a6-6c2d7b27-78ad-4aa6-8250-822ae92e5d8a-new-sandworm-dune-copy.webp 600w,\n/static/756267cb946466052e800a3def6c74f2/81547/30eda44c-688f-4b44-a53b-fd00a43373a6-6c2d7b27-78ad-4aa6-8250-822ae92e5d8a-new-sandworm-dune-copy.webp 1200w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px, 100vw"}]},"width":1200,"height":630}}}}}}},{"node":{"title":"Report: Another Terrible Year For Horse Worms ","slug":"report-another-terrible-year-for-horse-worms","content":"\n<p>Amidst the continued popularity of Ivermectin to treat COVID-19, the horse worm community is set to enter a third year of record deaths and unemployment.

Naturally when the pandemic first began we were all very concerned about how this would affect the filming of Eastenders, it’s a big show down here, however we were all still able to go into work as the virus didn’t affect us. We don’t have lungs, you see. Cos we’re worms.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘However somebody heard that you could treat the virus with horse dewormer and, well, boom that was the end for a lot of us. Humans taking it themselves was not the issue, there’s not a lot of work going in the human arsehole market, especially since the Joe Rogan and Laurence Fox followers most likely to take it tend to block the entrance with their own heads. The problem was the money going into Ivermectin, meaning production of it went up and these days you can’t find a stable residence in a horse for love nor money.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8216;It&#8217;s not been all bad.

I’m trying to worm my way into patent law, it’s been a long time love of mine but I just need someone to pick me up on it.

It is clear that it&#8217;s too soon to truly gauge the public opinion of LFTs, yet we can only speculate increasing demand over time as many are displayed in physical photo albums known as “art galleries”.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Earlier this week we got the opportunity to speak to one of the first new LFT owners themselves at none other than York University’s very own LFT testing centre. When asked for a comment he said, “So I walk in for my Covid test yeah, and the guy looks at me and he says ‘first time?’ So I say “nah mate” ‘cause we’re two years into this pandemic I think I know my way around an LFT by now. Anyways, he takes me into the little testing cubicle and I’m sitting there waiting for him to give me the testing kit or something, thinking this is a bit odd. I&#8217;m usually done by now. Shit you not the man comes back with a picture of a fucking monkey. So yeah, anyways. Probably given you covid now.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our reporter was unable to gleam more on the subject as immediately after this meeting they were notified of a need to self-isolate for the next 14 days, due to an unrelated contraction of Covid-19.

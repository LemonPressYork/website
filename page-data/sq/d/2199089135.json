He&#8217;s a silent, borderline-Lovecraftian force of nature, but like so many damaged people I believe he is just one caring ear and tender embrace away from being fixed. I can fix him, and here&#8217;s the reasons why.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>1 &#8211; I too am opposed by capitalism and understand his anger towards the industrial complex. Not all of the worms attitudes have to be changed, I just have to get him to attack the system in less environmentally-catastrophic ways, like lobbying, or starting a podcast. I can change him, unless he just hates the miners in a Thatcher way, in which case I do also have a good track record of fixing Tories (albeit there will be less sexual tension on my part.)&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>2 &#8211; There&#8217;s probably even bigger worms. You haven&#8217;t seen them, but there&#8217;s a whole worm community going on down there where there&#8217;s probably a load of bigger worms making fun of him. But to me he&#8217;s a big boy, I would let him be the big spoon and get all the protector role vibes his brushed ego needs.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>3 &#8211; I would also let him be the little spoon. Half of that angry energy probably comes from him feeling like he has to be in the aggressor role to fit into society, but my wormy dude doesn&#8217;t have to live up to that role all the time. I&#8217;m not exactly sure how I could be the big spoon to a several-kilometer wide worm, other than clinging onto him like a dissapoined nit on a bald man, but just knowing there is someone ready to wrap their arms around him and tell him it&#8217;s all going to be okay should calm my big boy down.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>4 &#8211; Massive mouth hole. Huge. Multi-layered. Sucking. I don&#8217;t need to think about how to give that worm reassurance, I&#8217;ll just let that sandwussy get to work and let him measure how much I value him by the gallon.</p>\n","author":{"node":{"name":"Dan Saxotweet"}},"featuredImage":{"node":{"id":"cG9zdDozOTg=","localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"id":"e8476631-ed6a-5402-b9cc-21981ccc54bf","gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/756267cb946466052e800a3def6c74f2/fcb2f/30eda44c-688f-4b44-a53b-fd00a43373a6-6c2d7b27-78ad-4aa6-8250-822ae92e5d8a-new-sandworm-dune-copy.jpg","srcSet":"/static/756267cb946466052e800a3def6c74f2/f1930/30eda44c-688f-4b44-a53b-fd00a43373a6-6c2d7b27-78ad-4aa6-8250-822ae92e5d8a-new-sandworm-dune-copy.jpg 300w,\n/static/756267cb946466052e800a3def6c74f2/550ca/30eda44c-688f-4b44-a53b-fd00a43373a6-6c2d7b27-78ad-4aa6-8250-822ae92e5d8a-new-sandworm-dune-copy.jpg 600w,\n/static/756267cb946466052e800a3def6c74f2/fcb2f/30eda44c-688f-4b44-a53b-fd00a43373a6-6c2d7b27-78ad-4aa6-8250-822ae92e5d8a-new-sandworm-dune-copy.jpg 1200w","sizes":"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/756267cb946466052e800a3def6c74f2/355a9/30eda44c-688f-4b44-a53b-fd00a43373a6-6c2d7b27-78ad-4aa6-8250-822ae92e5d8a-new-sandworm-dune-copy.avif 300w,\n/static/756267cb946466052e800a3def6c74f2/1260c/30eda44c-688f-4b44-a53b-fd00a43373a6-6c2d7b27-78ad-4aa6-8250-822ae92e5d8a-new-sandworm-dune-copy.avif 600w,\n/static/756267cb946466052e800a3def6c74f2/30577/30eda44c-688f-4b44-a53b-fd00a43373a6-6c2d7b27-78ad-4aa6-8250-822ae92e5d8a-new-sandworm-dune-copy.avif 1200w","type":"image/avif","sizes":"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px, 100vw"},{"srcSet":"/static/756267cb946466052e800a3def6c74f2/c7da1/30eda44c-688f-4b44-a53b-fd00a43373a6-6c2d7b27-78ad-4aa6-8250-822ae92e5d8a-new-sandworm-dune-copy.webp 300w,\n/static/756267cb946466052e800a3def6c74f2/22c65/30eda44c-688f-4b44-a53b-fd00a43373a6-6c2d7b27-78ad-4aa6-8250-822ae92e5d8a-new-sandworm-dune-copy.webp 600w,\n/static/756267cb946466052e800a3def6c74f2/81547/30eda44c-688f-4b44-a53b-fd00a43373a6-6c2d7b27-78ad-4aa6-8250-822ae92e5d8a-new-sandworm-dune-copy.webp 1200w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px, 100vw"}]},"width":1200,"height":630}}}}}},{"slug":"joe-pesci-confirms-hes-legally-allowed-to-try-to-enter-your-house-if-you-leave-it-vacant-for-more-than-15-minutes","title":"Joe Pesci Confirms He’s Legally Allowed To Try to Enter Your House If You Leave it Vacant For More Than 15 Minutes","excerpt":"<p>Joe Pesci has confirmed he has full legal rights to attempt to enter your house if it’s left unattended for 15 minutes.

These are my genuine thoughts on the album, I wouldn’t normally listen but I felt left out on the tweets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>First impressions</strong> &#8211; This is too long. 30 songs? I have not had 30 quality thoughts in my life, let alone enough to transform into 29 songs plus an additional longer song.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>State of Grace</strong> &#8211; This was an okay song! I imagine if you gave 1000 pop songs from the past decade to an AI it would generate this one on the 6th attempt, but hey it was nice enough! I might even listen to it at least once more before moving back to my 5 frequented podcasts!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Red</strong> &#8211; Hmm. If this is the title song then we may be in trouble, like if Shakesphere had named ‘Hamlet’ ‘Polonius’ instead; sure he’s an alright character, but not the main attraction worth coming back for. The lyrics are the thing throwing me off, like the ‘loving him is like X’ pattern takes me way out of the song. I feel like I’m at the pork pie factory watching it get made. For the rest of the song, see my comments for ‘State of Grace’. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tenacious</strong> &#8211; I can like songs! That’s better! I may actually listen to this one out of choice, or at least shuffled in my playlist of under 50 songs! However, I feel like I’m reading the penultimate paragraph of a kid’s English essay, the new ideas are wearing thin and I hope you have some new thoughts about this dude between songs 4 and 30.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>I Knew You Were Trouble </strong>&#8211; This one broke into my real world (shopping centers and school trip minibusses) so I had heard it before. That’s pretty much the review, it’s a song I had heard before. I wasn&#8217;t familiar enough with the material to pick up on subtle differences, however, Taylor does sound more bored on the ‘trouble trouble trouble’ chorus bits. I did want to apologize to Taylor for keeping her when she is clearly bored, but this whole thing was her idea!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>All Too Well</strong> &#8211; Okay my fears shown in ‘Tenacious’ were confirmed, we’re out of ideas about this dude (I have never experienced Jake’s work either so I couldn’t comment on that side of things). If she was writing the essay in an exam I wouldn’t give her extra paper to finish, she has just swapped the drums for a guitar like a kid suddenly writing in a blue pen. I do enjoy blue pen, but come on now, you should’ve studied harder or made the previous paragraphs more concise!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>22</strong> &#8211; Skipped it because I have that milestone coming up and I refuse to think about it. Even if the song is happy, the passage of time scares me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>I Almost Do</strong> &#8211; A bit Tory to be honest. This dude has a chair (presumably comfy) in a house overlooking the city, and he can afford an entire week of partying? Nah his dad’s an investment banker mate, you don’t need an entire album to bring him down,  just a copy of the Panama Papers. I know I should have an emotional investment in these songs, but I can’t stop thinking about house prices. There’s no penthouse room in London affordable to someone with socialist tendencies. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together</strong> &#8211; You know those films where the actor meant to be playing a teenage protagonist is about 30 and it’s obvious? This song is that feeling in audio form. I know it’s probably deliberately in that style, but I can’t help thinking about Zac Efron. So not entirely a bad thing.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>It should probably be noted at this point the condition I am writing this in, it’s very late and the rhomboid I injured doing layup is full-on</em> throbbing. Instead of the doctors,<em> I have a massive Aldi popcorn bag and 21 more songs in the album. Fuck me. I’m going to bed and finishing it later. </em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Stay Stay Stay</strong> &#8211; Any intro that reminds me of Kevin Macleod deserves to be skipped, I half expected her to ask me to smash the like button. Made it 2 minutes in and moved on, hope I didn’t miss her doing the Chubby Bunny Challenge!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Last Time </strong>&#8211; THAT’S NOT TAYLOR’S VOICE! I got scared, no idea who this dude is, I had about an hour of just Taylor and the new dude spooked me. The song is kind of cute, it might even provoke an emotional response out of me, I could conceivably see myself putting this song on out of choice. She’s got a 2/10 hit ratio on this album at the moment, but that’s fine, not all of them can be bangers!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Holy Ground</strong> &#8211; We’re back to the English Essay problem, you can’t just turn up the (snare?) and repeat all the following points. I got bored and checked Twitter during it. I saw quite a funny tweet, and by the time I shared it the song had stopped. So there’s that I guess.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Sad Beautiful Tragic</strong> &#8211; I am well aware that if I had a normal emotional relationship with music this would be one of the songs that made me sad. I can see all the sad-making components, but it’s just doing nothing for me? There are still 2 minutes of it to go at the time of writing, I might finish off that popcorn&#8230; Never mind, it finished before I could reach the bag. Now my back hurts again. I hate everything happening in my proximity at the moment. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Lucky One</strong> &#8211; Why did the first fucking line make me think of pseudonyms, this entire song is going to be about R****** in my head now. I’m sorry Taylor. This is a pleasant enough song, I wouldn’t go out of my way to listen to it but I rather enjoyed my time while it was on. Less of an earworn, more of an earslug (in a good way), I can tell it’s there and I’m fine with that but it’s not really getting stuck.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Everything Has Changed</strong> &#8211; It was on for about 30 seconds before I zoned out and replied to a text. It wasn’t a particularly important text in all honesty. My mother asked me about a coffee machine she might get Dad for Christmas. It seemed like a rather good deal, compatible with quite a few different makes of pods, but we’ve had coffee machines before, and they never get used again after a month. Anyway, I zoned back in for the final 30 seconds, and they seemed much like the first 30. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Starlight</strong> &#8211; Okay I think Taylor has a weird formula for a song, called ‘tell a story in chronological order but randomly speed up the narration’s time scale so it always ties into the chorus’. Like she will be describing a nice enough day in slow detail then suddenly YACHT PRINCESS DANCE STARLIGHT. Sure the chorus is decently upbeat, but now I can see the formula I feel like I’m at the pork pie factory again. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Begin Again</strong> &#8211; ‘He always said he didn’t get this song’ well that’s just too direct an attack on me, I feel bad now. I did like this one, it was like getting a hug from a good-but-not-close friend, it was comfy and cozy, but I’m not sure it will be a regular thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Moment I Knew</strong> &#8211; I spent the last 3 minutes wondering what a ‘baby I’m right here smile’ would look like. I can’t imagine there are teeth involved, is it one of those smaller ones? Then how do you differentiate that one from all the other reasons to smile a bit? Is it applicable to actual babies?  I would listen to the rest of the song but it feels very specific like I am overhearing a conversation I shouldn’t be and now I feel rude. I am trying to enjoy the music, but confusion and second-hand social embarrassment are all I’m getting from it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Breakfast break now. I am well aware this is 1200 words now, but you’ve all spent the last week celebrating a 10 minute version of a song as a masterpiece (and believe me I will be the judge of that) so you can endure this form of self-indulgence for a bit longer.&nbsp;</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Come Back&#8230; Be Here</strong> &#8211; Nevermind, I was meant to have breakfast but I just kind of sat watching Youtube clips until I got bored enough to come back to the album. This one feels like my earlier ‘AI of 1000 songs’ but some weird glitch means the previous songs from the album are used in the AI. Feel like if I added any three songs from the last 18 I could swap them in and out and not notice. Apart from the Snow Patrol guy one. Maybe I should just listen to Snow Patrol instead. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Girl At Home</strong> &#8211; Yes! This one sounds different! Yes! I legitimately love the music part of this, the lyrics of ‘a girl calling out a guy for having another girl at home’ are hard for me to relate to, but if there was like a Swedish version of the lyrics that I could pretend meant anything I would have this on repeat today!&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>State of Grace (Acoustic Version) </strong>&#8211; Demolish that goodwill I just gave you why don’t you, this is a repeat! Admittedly it is a better version and if I heard this in isolation I would enjoy it a lot more, but you know what they say about grandmothers and bikes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ronan</strong> &#8211; After writing my initial paragraph I Googled the meaning behind this song and, well, moving on.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Better Man</strong> &#8211; Need a second opinion, do other people think the album gets better as it goes on, or have I just been broken in by 22 Swift songs in a row? I actually found this mildly touching for a bit, it could’ve ended after 3 minutes easily but those were 180 seconds of heaviness. Huh. I hope this is actually to do with the song and not just some form of audio gaslighting, because I’m going to relisten to a few of these out of my own free will. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nothing New</strong> &#8211; I actually came back to my room excited to hear more of this album. I suppose this song wasn&#8217;t meant for me, I do understand it (have you seen the tweets I liked? I’m so bloody in touch with that feminine side of myself mate!), but I just wanted to listen to Phoebe’s cover of That Funny Feeling for the 98th time. Then argue in the comments about why the original version is actually the best thing Bo has done for the 97th time. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Babe</strong> &#8211; AI generating song machine goes brrrrr ect.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Message in a Bottle</strong> &#8211; I bopped to it. Rather a sad sight really, just a dude bopping in his room, but I bopped nonetheless. What a nice little song! Not sure why this one stood out, it might just be the swift-induced brainrot, I’m going to have some beans on toast and finish this thing.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>I Bet You Think About Me</strong> &#8211; Beans eaten. Coffee got. I’m ready to have my final dose of emotions. Those emotions are currently ‘fury at whoever decided to bring a HARMONICA to this gig&#8217;. Admittedly the only country song I’ve ever heard was Bo Burnham’s Country song, and as an introduction to the genre, I’m not a fan. I want to Dunkirk the lyrics out of this song and put them in a better place, away from harmonicas. Can we do a swap with the Girl at Home lyrics? Girl at the Barn?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Forever Winter</strong> &#8211; See my comments for Come Back / Babe. It’s slightly better than those, so that’s nice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Run</strong> &#8211; Exactly the same reaction as Sad Beautiful Tragic. Maybe the beans absorbed my sentimentality.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Very First Night</strong> &#8211; She’s back baby! Touching and boppable, why couldn’t it be 30 songs of this kind of thing? Or just like 5 songs I approve of. I might just loop this song because I know the one that’s next and I fear what will happen to my mentions if I don’t like it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>All Too Well (10 Minute Version)</strong> &#8211; I am trusting you people, the phone is going away, I am going to give this thing a chance, yeah? Okay 3,2,1&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right I didn’t mean to start a second paragraph here, I thought it would be an anticlimactic summary, I was ready to describe it as an edging orgy. And I stand by what I said for the shorter version in that it’s all been said in the album before. But, on its own, that was beautiful. Beautiful. It was art and it was fucking beautiful. Jesus Christ. I don’t know why this was the one that got me. The narrative formula I noticed in ‘Starlight’ can breathe here and just tell a story. Can somebody send me songs like this that exist? I’ve actually put it on twice in a row, not even as a bit. I thought it would be 10 minutes of Jake-bashing, but it was more like looking at a snowglobe. A perfect bit of emotion captured. I don’t even know what I’m writing now. I need to go for a walk. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Final Verdict</strong> &#8211; I am going to listen to at least 5 of these again, which is a good score! Genuinely! Please send me more album recommendations, this was rather fun!</p>\n","author":{"node":{"name":"Dan Saxotweet"}},"featuredImage":{"node":{"id":"cG9zdDoyMjQ=","localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"id":"72d84074-eb98-5687-a09c-dfd75b33e45d","gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/f70f516e67ccd9329fd3b8be2524ee04/1b035/6966856933_68ed84b014_b.jpg","srcSet":"/static/f70f516e67ccd9329fd3b8be2524ee04/99f43/6966856933_68ed84b014_b.jpg 250w,\n/static/f70f516e67ccd9329fd3b8be2524ee04/28380/6966856933_68ed84b014_b.jpg 500w,\n/static/f70f516e67ccd9329fd3b8be2524ee04/1b035/6966856933_68ed84b014_b.jpg 1000w","sizes":"(min-width: 1000px) 1000px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/f70f516e67ccd9329fd3b8be2524ee04/ea46c/6966856933_68ed84b014_b.avif 250w,\n/static/f70f516e67ccd9329fd3b8be2524ee04/aad76/6966856933_68ed84b014_b.avif 500w,\n/static/f70f516e67ccd9329fd3b8be2524ee04/ea316/6966856933_68ed84b014_b.avif 1000w","type":"image/avif","sizes":"(min-width: 1000px) 1000px, 100vw"},{"srcSet":"/static/f70f516e67ccd9329fd3b8be2524ee04/48571/6966856933_68ed84b014_b.webp 250w,\n/static/f70f516e67ccd9329fd3b8be2524ee04/76f01/6966856933_68ed84b014_b.webp 500w,\n/static/f70f516e67ccd9329fd3b8be2524ee04/b7ef5/6966856933_68ed84b014_b.webp 1000w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1000px) 1000px, 100vw"}]},"width":1000,"height":667}}}}}},{"slug":"nouse-podcast-review-my-flatmates-endless-screaming","title":"Nouse Podcast Review: My Flatmate’s Endless Screaming","excerpt":"<p>I hate podcasts, and for years have taken great pride in never having listened to one.

Even if somebody is playing one within earshot of me I will jettison myself away from them and scream over it until it is no longer heard, such is my unbridled hatred of the medium. One time a close friend of mine recommended <em>Welcome to Night Vale</em> to me and I had to be physically sick on the spot, so I surprised myself when I found myself listening to one very special podcast every single night.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My Flatmate&#8217;s Endless Screaming started relatively small, but has now amassed a sizable and captive audience. Like many listeners inside the house, next door to the house, or just passing by the house at 2am, I was not sure about this podcast when it first launched. The premise of someone screaming endlessly did not immediately attract me, but after 8 straight months I have grown to love the variety of screams. The most endearing element of the podcast is the complete lack of structure; sometimes the hosts can spend up to twenty minutes on tangential screams, like the time they changed from high-pitched shouting to baboon-esque howls, making it a must-listen for any fans of extreme nature.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is some consistency in the shows, as every one is spiced up with prolonged musical interludes that in the past year have covered a wide range of 10 unique songs. I have no idea how the production team got licence to play the tracks to an entire street of people nightly, but they have certainly done their bit in ensuring some of the decade’s biggest hits live on through being burned into our collective memories (even if the host often struggles to remember half the words, us listeners will never forget).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They have also managed to get a large number of guests over the past year, a great achievement given the lockdown rules and the host’s own physical and personality-based shortcomings. Each one brings something to the table, like the lacrosse player with surprisingly firm views on Lenin, or the two DJ mates during the ‘January Exam Season special’. While there is never the same guest twice, the host always tries to form close connections with each one so&nbsp; you really feel as if you are in the same room as them, the bed, and the Bose L1 System B1 Bass Module Subwoofer.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall I would recommend listening to My Flatmate’s Endless Screaming, with a few caveats attached. While it can be enjoyed from anywhere I have found it best experienced from underneath, ideally binged for weeks at a time, available for only £95 a week plus bills. Please. I’ll even let you keep the TV.&nbsp;</p>\n","author":{"node":{"name":"Dan Saxotweet"}},"featuredImage":{"node":{"id":"cG9zdDo5OA==","localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"id":"e543e067-b5c7-56c4-907c-0df4cfa1e2ac","gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/c82ad507f5a6fcedb09beaf448955958/880d6/girl-1990347_1920.jpg","srcSet":"/static/c82ad507f5a6fcedb09beaf448955958/c5341/girl-1990347_1920.jpg 480w,\n/static/c82ad507f5a6fcedb09beaf448955958/163d5/girl-1990347_1920.jpg 960w,\n/static/c82ad507f5a6fcedb09beaf448955958/880d6/girl-1990347_1920.jpg 1920w","sizes":"(min-width: 1920px) 1920px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/c82ad507f5a6fcedb09beaf448955958/a46c8/girl-1990347_1920.avif 480w,\n/static/c82ad507f5a6fcedb09beaf448955958/86bbb/girl-1990347_1920.avif 960w,\n/static/c82ad507f5a6fcedb09beaf448955958/e4302/girl-1990347_1920.avif 1920w","type":"image/avif","sizes":"(min-width: 1920px) 1920px, 100vw"},{"srcSet":"/static/c82ad507f5a6fcedb09beaf448955958/543c3/girl-1990347_1920.webp 480w,\n/static/c82ad507f5a6fcedb09beaf448955958/a840f/girl-1990347_1920.webp 960w,\n/static/c82ad507f5a6fcedb09beaf448955958/afb59/girl-1990347_1920.webp 1920w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1920px) 1920px, 100vw"}]},"width":1920,"height":1413}}}}}},{"slug":"the-himbos-journey","title":"The Himbos Journey ","excerpt":"<p>The story structure of ‘The Hero’s Journey’ has been a staple of any storytelling media, from ‘Star Wars’ and ‘Shrek’ to ‘Harry Potter’ and ‘The Hobbit’.

But all of those are stories for nerds, where is the stereotypical fiction formula for dudes who fuck? Fret no more, for this is The Himbos Journey.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Call to Adventure </strong>&#8211; Our himbo is awoken to a glowing vibrating phone, with a simple text of ‘u up ?x’ lying across it. Of course, our naive himbo was in bed by 11pm and put his phone away to reduce his blue light exposure, but the thought of some poor female needing his help and platonic support wakes him from his slumber.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Refusal of the Call</strong> &#8211; Through a rapid-fire deployment of nudes, our himbo learns this call for help is instead a call for mutual head! While intrigued by the proposal, the complexity and high-stakes of the mission intimidates him. In a half-awake state of anxiety, out himbo rejects the call.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Meeting the Mentor </strong>&nbsp;&#8211; Lost and without a sense of direction, our disheartened Himbo eventually has a chance encounter with a mysterious MILF. With a trustworthy amount of milkiness, the MILF takes him under her wing and shows him the ways in which one must pleasure a woman.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Crossing the Threshold </strong>&nbsp;&#8211; Armed with confidence, a bagful of clit tricks and a bicep pump, our Himbo leaves his cave in search of bimbos to pleasure. Sure he is nervous about leaving behind his regular sleeping schedule and the safe ideas of women he could get with in his head, but with that first step out of his confidence zone he can only move forwards.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Trials, Allies &amp; Enemies </strong>&#8211; The main section of the story, where our Himbo goes through a series of women in a bid to improve himself. Along the way he makes allies through his gentlemanly treatment of bimbos and their mothers, but finds dangerous enemies in the form of their boyfriends. Whether they are extremely buff, have scary mates, or ‘know computers’, our himbo overcomes the threat of each boyfriend and becomes a stronger himbo along the way.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Approach to the Innermost Cave </strong>&#8211; With every bimbo in an Uber-able distance pleasured, our himbo receives the exact same ‘u up x’ text from the same girl at the start of the journey. Now a changed man, he summons up the courage to reply, and within minutes the ultimate meeting of the ‘imbos is on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Supreme Ordeal </strong>&#8211; After a life-changing journey of becoming a man, our himbo manages to last 10 minutes, which is still twice as long as either of them thought he would. Nice.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Reward </strong>&#8211; Our story ends with our himbo in the afterglow of a battle hard thought, concluding as the bimbo turns to our conquering hero and saying ‘I genuinely didn’t hate all of that experience’. No reward has ever been sweeter.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Daniel Bennett</p>\n","author":{"node":{"name":"Dan Saxotweet"}},"featuredImage":{"node":{"id":"cG9zdDo3Mg==","localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"id":"e9096e31-67f5-5f25-8ee2-e12346a11c04","gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/2wBDABALDA4MChAODQ4SERATGCgaGBYWGDEjJR0oOjM9PDkzODdASFxOQERXRTc4UG1RV19iZ2hnPk1xeXBkeFxlZ2P/2wBDARESEhgVGC8aGi9jQjhCY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2P/wgARCAAZABQDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAGAAAAwEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIDBAH/xAAXAQEBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQME/9oADAMBAAIQAxAAAAGcsenpYTpIjx5kcUP/xAAdEAACAgEFAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAgARAxASEyAx/9oACAEBAAEFAlybXdnfTERZe1PoNTkl9P/EABYRAAMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIgIf/aAAgBAwEBPwEIn//EABkRAQEBAAMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEAAhESMf/aAAgBAgEBPwHL2ZI2nly3/8QAHxAAAAUEAwAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEQESEDEiAiMUFh/9oACAEBAAY/Aipt64ktekkWkvGP/8QAHBAAAwADAAMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAERITFBEFGh/9oACAEBAAE/IbazxWjWBK2r7Qe9lHt9KtIvZsyUWUdLCod7H5//2gAMAwEAAgADAAAAEKzF8f/EABkRAAMAAwAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABERAhQf/aAAgBAwEBPxDg3rERD//EABkRAAMAAwAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABIRFBYf/aAAgBAgEBPxBiG95KENjsf//EAB0QAQEAAgIDAQAAAAAAAAAAAAERADEhQRBhccH/2gAIAQEAAT8QGHgDsUnyd4QIh2Y6V94ARHGWVsCnn3kDUXQ41+ZWgc95HhDY6fWOxT0i8Yju3zwO/H//2Q=="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/5064185402ee5f04d0bc57477e21f3a0/7663d/himbos-journey-2.jpg","srcSet":"/static/5064185402ee5f04d0bc57477e21f3a0/f05fe/himbos-journey-2.jpg 410w,\n/static/5064185402ee5f04d0bc57477e21f3a0/66fdc/himbos-journey-2.jpg 819w,\n/static/5064185402ee5f04d0bc57477e21f3a0/7663d/himbos-journey-2.jpg 1638w","sizes":"(min-width: 1638px) 1638px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/5064185402ee5f04d0bc57477e21f3a0/96121/himbos-journey-2.avif 410w,\n/static/5064185402ee5f04d0bc57477e21f3a0/f9218/himbos-journey-2.avif 819w,\n/static/5064185402ee5f04d0bc57477e21f3a0/5ee0d/himbos-journey-2.avif 1638w","type":"image/avif","sizes":"(min-width: 1638px) 1638px, 100vw"},{"srcSet":"/static/5064185402ee5f04d0bc57477e21f3a0/f1b6e/himbos-journey-2.webp 410w,\n/static/5064185402ee5f04d0bc57477e21f3a0/b303a/himbos-journey-2.webp 819w,\n/static/5064185402ee5f04d0bc57477e21f3a0/10af7/himbos-journey-2.webp 1638w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1638px) 1638px, 100vw"}]},"width":1638,"height":2048}}}}}},{"slug":"bourne-in-the-wrong-generation-announced","title":"Bourne: In The Wrong Generation Announced","excerpt":"<p>In great news for all twenty &#8216;Jason Bourne&#8217; fans, the sixth film of the blockbuster franchise has been announced with a twist.

The Hulu-exclusive sequel to a movie you thought about twice in 4 years will see our hero sent to the year 2021, where everything has changed and he must fight to reclaim his country from the soft snowflakes who have infiltrated it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The film features Bourne shaking his head and tutting disapprovingly at teenagers attending therapy sessions, before an epic scene of him drinking copious amounts of whisky in a bar to cope with the difficulties of the job. This precedes a dramatic nightclub scene where Bourne shoots a DJ and the entire dancefloor up in order to stop the current chart hits being played, replacing the disks with his own Vinyl record of ‘Queen II’. There is also epic shaky-cam footage of Bourne using lethal force to defend the Winston Churchill statue from a horde of protesters and, as per tradition for the gritty realistic franchise, the film follows it up with a realistic portrayal of the consequences (a 30-second montage of Bourne completing paperwork).&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The final confrontation is of him confronting the dastardly stock-Google-photo-of-a-blue-haired-feminist, cooly growling ‘I was Bourne in the wrong generation’ before loudly shooting his load over the film&#8217;s love interest. This defeats the feminist, because as we all know feminists are allergic to the sight of hertosexual ejaculate.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><span class=\"wp-image-9

My thoughts are only with those who are suffering most due to this. No, not his unspecified number of children, or those who have suffered as a result of the countless scandals that 50+ government officials suddenly chose to remember this week, but the new Sabbatical Officers who posted their introductory posts just as the UK started exploding this month. I’ve dug through what we already know about these new trusty trustees to find out who they are endorsing to be the new leader of the Tories. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Pierrick &#8211; Rory Stewart </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pierrick has done nothing as President yet, I am already a huge fan. He has already had the character-building moment of being left on read by Charlie Jeffrey during his time as the Environment and Ethics Officer for the UK’s 93rd-most sustainable University, so he already carries more cynicism than even the most hungover version of POD ever had. While I am sure that becoming further submerged in the middle-managing bureaucracy of YUSU will not cause further strife and definitely won’t turn him into the fucking Joker, there is a chance that he could become York’s very own Rory Stewart: a sensible voice in a sea of madness who steps away from the ladder of power after seizing the hearts of the people, before starting a podcast with an accused war criminal (try to catch one at the next<em> Nouse</em> Alumni event).</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Deb &#8211; Matt Hancock</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the five years that I have been at this University, Deb is the Sabbatical Officer I am most convinced that I could approach at a party and sell an NFT to (yes I considered the OTHER obvious candidate, but Deb edged it as he does not yet give the impression that he would stab me on sight for being a part of student media.) And the current flagbearer of crypto in the Tory party is, genuinely, Matt Hancock. Deb and Matt The Shagger are kindred spirits, being outdoor adventurers with UNORTHODOX policies regarding people with disabilities and a burning desire to spend a fortune on digital services of questionable usefulness! We should do everything in our power to get Matt and Deb in the same room, then sell the resultant footage to either Netflix or the FBI. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Franki &#8211; Boris Johnson</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>For all his many, many, many flaws, Boris Johnson is the only Prime Minister who has ever given off the vibe that he would care about Roses, which is in all honesty a worse crime than causing 180,000 COVID-19 deaths. Think about it; a weekend of intense sports between the mostly-privately-educated, for glory that’s based on a historic squabble? All that’s needed now is comfier sleeping arrangements to allow for mass-impregnation orgies and our caretaker PM would volunteer to fund the tournament personally! </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Rohan &#8211; Nadine Dorries</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the former ComedySoc chair, Rohan must endorse the banter candidate; and who else would be funnier than Boris’s political widow, Nadine Dorries? Who could forget that time she did a TikTok rap (#Cringe)! Or that time she said online films were ‘downstreamed’ (she blamed dyslexia, what’s more comedic than a member of a disability-hostile government facing hostility due to a disability! Bantz)! Or her entire voting record (we keep making jokes about her and she keeps on getting away with making awful political decisions without losing standing in her own party! What now? Does the solution involve more jokes?)</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Hannah &#8211; Liz Truss</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you have any idea how excruciating it is to write satire about Community and Wellbeing Officers? So often they serve scandal-and-quirk-free tenures, and I would sooner publish my home address than any satire about most of the high-profile topics they deal with. The only good Community and Officer content was Effy’s #Bustice saga (a petition campaign that fixed the First Bus problem as effectively as that one digger fixed the Suez Canal problem), so any CAWO must naturally gravitate towards an MP who has had one singular funny moment. So step forwards Liz ‘Cheese and Pork Markets’ Truss, please collect your Sabbatical Officer endorsement and pray that the student-run activism pages don&#8217;t choose someone else instead.</p>\n","author":{"node":{"name":"Dan Saxotweet"}},"featuredImage":{"node":{"id":"cG9zdDo0MTU=","localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"id":"b0ce9918-aa51-5d77-a4f3-b11e1e3863d1","gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/png;base64,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"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/37f9542c118d18fffb2e1a94ddec3d5e/8a271/5_new_sabbs_edited-1536x1152-1.png","srcSet":"/static/37f9542c118d18fffb2e1a94ddec3d5e/b1958/5_new_sabbs_edited-1536x1152-1.png 384w,\n/static/37f9542c118d18fffb2e1a94ddec3d5e/569c7/5_new_sabbs_edited-1536x1152-1.png 768w,\n/static/37f9542c118d18fffb2e1a94ddec3d5e/8a271/5_new_sabbs_edited-1536x1152-1.png 1536w","sizes":"(min-width: 1536px) 1536px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/37f9542c118d18fffb2e1a94ddec3d5e/455fe/5_new_sabbs_edited-1536x1152-1.avif 384w,\n/static/37f9542c118d18fffb2e1a94ddec3d5e/f1859/5_new_sabbs_edited-1536x1152-1.avif 768w,\n/static/37f9542c118d18fffb2e1a94ddec3d5e/0df09/5_new_sabbs_edited-1536x1152-1.avif 1536w","type":"image/avif","sizes":"(min-width: 1536px) 1536px, 100vw"},{"srcSet":"/static/37f9542c118d18fffb2e1a94ddec3d5e/aad4b/5_new_sabbs_edited-1536x1152-1.webp 384w,\n/static/37f9542c118d18fffb2e1a94ddec3d5e/41f06/5_new_sabbs_edited-1536x1152-1.webp 768w,\n/static/37f9542c118d18fffb2e1a94ddec3d5e/95e44/5_new_sabbs_edited-1536x1152-1.webp 1536w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1536px) 1536px, 100vw"}]},"width":1536,"height":1152}}}}}},{"slug":"panopto-captions-actually-cry-for-help","title":"Panopto Captions Actually Cry For Help","excerpt":"<p>The University of York community was in shock today after it was discovered the Panopto captions were actually typed out by a manusing the service to send help messages.

The service, just assumed to be using a standard auto-captioning system that wasn’t<br>particularly fit for the purpose of online learning or assisting the hearing impaired, was in fact employing several dudes to write their<br>subtitles at the start of the pandemic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘It started off with 6 of us’ said the anonymous man, recently freed from his shackles. ‘Sure we were taken off the street and forced to<br>watch hundreds of hours of lectures, but we had a nice little team down there. We got along well, but all good things must come to an<br>end, and one by one we turned on each other. Bobby the Dazzler had been given the politics and economics lectures and over time<br>just became the most insufferable shit going, we took the decision to all strangle him in his sleep, ‘et tu Bobby’ style. Desmond<br>appreciated that reference, ot because he did the history lectures, but because he did the Interactive Media ones and so had a load of<br>free time on his hands to look at history videos. He eventually died after we were permitted a once-a-year movie night and he started<br>giving opinions on what film we should watch. Even in his last breath he was still demanding we watch Tenet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Next was Steve the STEM boy. Did you know physics is just applied maths? Did you know chemistry is just applied physics? Did you<br>know biology is just applied chemistry? Steve did! Oh fuck Steve did. He was wielding the stem knowledge like some form of<br>Quadrisci Infinity Gauntlet, he was a 50 year old construction worker who was about to discover reddit for the first time before we<br>finished him off. A mercy killing really.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Of course, all the captions had to be done, so we were given more work to do and mistakes eventually crept in. A typo here, a “their”<br>instead of “they’re” there, all understandable mistakes when you’re doing two at 4x speed simultaneously. The other two died from<br>the stress alone, which was inconvenient as I hadn’t eaten the meat off the others yet. But as our overlords seemed not to do<br>anything to correct the typos, I tested the water. Swear words, profanity, still nobody came to punish me. So for the past year I have<br>been littering it with clues in hope somebody would find me.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The anonymous man&#8217;s capture was discovered by final year Maths student Gwenyth Bytheway. &#8216;I was watching and suddenly the<br>caption said the cosine of theta times i was inversely proportional to the sum of gamma over log n, when instead it as clearly directly<br>poroprtional.

A spokesperson for the York Tories exclusively told <em>Nouse</em> that ‘our committee always strive to communicate clearly with the regular plebs below us in our society, however when writing the announcement of our fox hunting social we became distracted by the tragic news of the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill not making it through parliament, so a spelling mistake slipped through while we emotionally recovered’.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, nobody on the committee realised the mistake before the event itself and the group, donning full fox and hunter costumes, turned up to Courtyard only to be greeted by dozens of eager art fans all wanting to make cute bunting of foxes. ‘I didn’t suspect anything was weird at all!’ one fresher said after the event. ‘I just really love foxes! Sure I was disappointed to read that there was no fox hunting where we could chase those small guys around York to give them treats and pats on the head, but it was still fun to paint their faces on little flags while talking about the swarm of socialism with like minded people!’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This was not the first time a society has fallen victim to a typo. Several years ago the then-Sports President accidentally signed off on introducing water polio to the university, forcing the whole of West Campus to isolate while the lakes were sterilized. And there is still much debate as to which typo caused more trauma; Cat Society being rebranded as Cats Society with members forced to watch the 2019 film weekly, or when a particularly unfortunate autocorrect led to Dog Society hosting its meetings in a dark abandoned field near a car park. </p>\n","author":{"node":{"name":"Dan Saxotweet"}},"featuredImage":{"node":{"id":"cG9zdDozNDY=","localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"id":"97c78639-71d5-5ee0-ab14-6968eb0c3bc0","gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRqoAAABXRUJQVlA4IJ4AAABQBACdASoUAA8APtFUo0uoJKMhsAgBABoJQBOmUCrMwITDhHARCFaMrggAAOAgPtVNDKwrArWEs3FhmHIsn5KAP7K+l8Wtyc4UK0vTpub3EH1ywBq8kYNrcZIENgCPbAupJXLXgEQk69K1FNImsdxWq9a9bC6thSOvzeLryBTC1umPvhiHUNHy2LlRMQ8UgYsgBTwBqIBOEAptrUp4AA=="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/5c3bc49c1f8671c9a5c4bcd101118d1a/0a195/il_570xN.1625792187_5wc7.webp","srcSet":"/static/5c3bc49c1f8671c9a5c4bcd101118d1a/06a70/il_570xN.1625792187_5wc7.webp 143w,\n/static/5c3bc49c1f8671c9a5c4bcd101118d1a/7f4b8/il_570xN.1625792187_5wc7.webp 285w,\n/static/5c3bc49c1f8671c9a5c4bcd101118d1a/0a195/il_570xN.1625792187_5wc7.webp 570w","sizes":"(min-width: 570px) 570px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/5c3bc49c1f8671c9a5c4bcd101118d1a/42969/il_570xN.1625792187_5wc7.avif 143w,\n/static/5c3bc49c1f8671c9a5c4bcd101118d1a/7bb71/il_570xN.1625792187_5wc7.avif 285w,\n/static/5c3bc49c1f8671c9a5c4bcd101118d1a/b1a0a/il_570xN.1625792187_5wc7.avif 570w","type":"image/avif","sizes":"(min-width: 570px) 570px, 100vw"}]},"width":570,"height":428}}}}}},{"slug":"things-in-york-that-i-could-take-in-a-fight","title":"Things in York That I Could Take In a Fight ","excerpt":"<p>For legal reasons, everyone in this was the one initiating the fight, this is just my view from the perspective of self defense.  The Ruddy Shelduck &#8211; I&#8217;m not messing around here, one kick and that thing is done for, I don&#8217;t care about its status, in a combat situation I will strike any waterfowl&hellip; <a class=\"more-link\" href=\"/post/things-in-york-that-i-could-take-in-a-fight\">Continue reading <span class=\"screen-reader-text\">Things in York That I Could Take In a Fight </span></a></p>\n","content":"\n<p><em>For legal reasons, everyone in this was the one initiating the fight, this is just my view from the perspective of self defense. </em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Ruddy Shelduck &#8211; I&#8217;m not messing around here, one kick and that thing is done for, I don&#8217;t care about its status, in a combat situation I will strike any waterfowl and more of you should be aware of that fact.

The price is unbelievably high and the tubs are even smaller than you’d think. Avoid if possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Fishing Scam: </strong>We’re pretty sure fish can’t survive the toxic waters that surround the University of York, any attempt to convince you to feed the fish as some sort of romantic activity is a con. You’re more likely to be throwing fish food into someone&#8217;s discarded vape.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Free Pizza At Society Meetings and Elections:</strong> I’ve never actually been to a society meeting but I just don’t really believe it to be honest.

My Gen-Z flatmates crowded round, eager for my knowledge, hanging on my every word as I worked on my boiled caramel candy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I may be a mature student, but I put my teeth in the same way everybody else does and&nbsp; having returned to university after two years of living a high-flying lifestyle as a stay-at-home daughter during a plague, my return to education was an adjustment. Whilst 25 doesn’t&nbsp; appear that old, remember the X-Factor once had a specific category for the over- 25s, aptly titled the overs, albeit whether I’m over the hill or under it I am yet to decide. My main&nbsp; discrepancy within this article is the blatant mockery towards me by these ageist&nbsp; whippersnappers. I want to go on record and state that once you surpass 21, you’re not&nbsp; snatched by a hoard of demonic cloaked figures and escorted to the near-death star, nor do&nbsp; you suddenly turn into dust to be consumed by a wandering Roomba&#8230; whatever that is.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What does happen once you pass 21 is you’re swiftly yeeted into adulthood and instead of&nbsp; confronting Thanos, having finally called you out on the liver damage you sustained during&nbsp; those heavy nights out, you’re confronted with yourself and who you’re going to be. It sounds&nbsp; corny but put that phone down for one damn minute and listen up, in my old age I do have&nbsp; wisdom to impart and can truly say that growing older isn’t a curse, isn’t a burden, isn’t&nbsp; something to fear, it is exciting. Bar the climate emergency, the threat of war in Ukraine and&nbsp; Covid changing suits once again… we might not have very long left, however there is still the&nbsp; opportunity to grow into yourself whilst you can. Life is like any motorised vehicle, when you&nbsp; first begin driving it’s scary, you make a shit load of mistake, you’re overturned in a ditch a&nbsp; fair few times and you have to follow others just to make sure you’re driving in the correct&nbsp; lane.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, with time comes experience, young grasshopper, knowledge of what you like,  what you don’t, you define your tastes, you might upgrade, change your style and you might  even start enjoying yourself. The possibilities are endless and getting older is not  synonymous with being useless nor should it come with guilt that you’re a failure. It’s bloody  fantastic to grow into your individuality, to build your integrity and raise your standards,  cause boy were mine low in my youth. There is so much to look forward and if you can give  your attention to anything, give it to yourself, because one day you’ll have to confront the  dreams of your younger self whilst in your Metaverse care home and you’ll most likely have  to explain why you compromised them. Trust me, there is so much good to come, enjoy the growth and for goodness’s sake, put a coat on it&#8217;s freezing out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Emily Bearsley</em></p>\n","author":{"node":{"name":"Lemon Press Writers"}},"featuredImage":{"node":{"id":"cG9zdDozMjM=","localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"id":"5a5ed173-bc10-5276-a9b4-171177213976","gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/c89233a83cf8a27184cf24b7eccb00c9/5267c/clock-gc6eafc5c7_1920.jpg","srcSet":"/static/c89233a83cf8a27184cf24b7eccb00c9/fa695/clock-gc6eafc5c7_1920.jpg 480w,\n/static/c89233a83cf8a27184cf24b7eccb00c9/a0d3e/clock-gc6eafc5c7_1920.jpg 960w,\n/static/c89233a83cf8a27184cf24b7eccb00c9/5267c/clock-gc6eafc5c7_1920.jpg 1920w","sizes":"(min-width: 1920px) 1920px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/c89233a83cf8a27184cf24b7eccb00c9/a2690/clock-gc6eafc5c7_1920.avif 480w,\n/static/c89233a83cf8a27184cf24b7eccb00c9/41526/clock-gc6eafc5c7_1920.avif 960w,\n/static/c89233a83cf8a27184cf24b7eccb00c9/f46cf/clock-gc6eafc5c7_1920.avif 1920w","type":"image/avif","sizes":"(min-width: 1920px) 1920px, 100vw"},{"srcSet":"/static/c89233a83cf8a27184cf24b7eccb00c9/95a23/clock-gc6eafc5c7_1920.webp 480w,\n/static/c89233a83cf8a27184cf24b7eccb00c9/5bdbe/clock-gc6eafc5c7_1920.webp 960w,\n/static/c89233a83cf8a27184cf24b7eccb00c9/9c00f/clock-gc6eafc5c7_1920.webp 1920w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1920px) 1920px, 100vw"}]},"width":1920,"height":1280}}}}}},{"slug":"inhabitant-of-dying-planet-celebrates-exam-results-with-pathetic-tiny-treat%ef%bf%bc","title":"Inhabitant of Dying Planet Celebrates Exam Results With Pathetic Tiny Treat","excerpt":"<p>Whilst scientist released a report predicting societal collapse in the event of extreme climate change, local York student Devon McAllister celebrated getting an ultimately-meaningless mark on his Quantum Chemistry exam paper by getting an underwhelming takeaway in a move that experts are calling ‘a pathetic display of ignorance’.  &#8216;I&#8217;m shocked, when I handed it in&hellip; <a class=\"more-link\" href=\"/post/inhabitant-of-dying-planet-celebrates-exam-results-with-pathetic-tiny-treat%ef%bf%bc\">Continue reading <span class=\"screen-reader-text\">Inhabitant of Dying Planet Celebrates Exam Results With Pathetic Tiny Treat</span></a></p>\n","content":"\n<p>Whilst scientist released a report predicting societal collapse in the event of extreme climate change, local York student Devon McAllister celebrated getting an ultimately-meaningless mark on his Quantum Chemistry exam paper by getting an underwhelming takeaway in a move that experts are calling ‘a pathetic display of ignorance’. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8216;I&#8217;m shocked, when I handed it in I thought I had barely passed, I seriously never expected to get a first on it!&#8217; said Devon, who quite rightly held the assumption that nothing good would ever happen to him again.

Instead of watching the Doomsday clock Devon watched the Deliveroo map and by some miracle the rider did not sporadically lose the will to live before the food was dropped off. The reward for weeks of hard work, an extra large burger with an extortionate delivery fee, was deemed to be ‘a bit soggy and cold’ by Devon who had to have some crisps less than an hour later after the underwhelming meal left him unfilled.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A psychology professor at the University of York noted that ‘quite simply we are living in a post-YUSU-declaring-a-climate-emergency world, and it is genuinely rather disturbing to see the lengths this young man will go to in order to mentally distance himself from that fact. What on earth will this man get if he graduates? Two burgers? Four? An extra side because it’s a “big day”?

I just want to make that clear. I have never killed, injured or in any other way caused misfortune to the final pair of Northern White Rhinos in existence. However, in the unfortunate case that I or anyone reading this were to completely unintentionally slaughter those two beautiful, surprisingly-fragile-boned creatures, and I/they happened to panic and bring their bodies to York rather than own up to it, I have created a handy review of the potential hiding places.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Exhibition Centre &#8211; We have all at some point or another wandered down the endless corridors of Physics&nbsp; and thought &#8220;yes, here&#8217;s a place that could conceivably hide the corpses of the last two Northern White Rhinos”. You wouldn’t even have to continue to worry about people trying to find the rhino murderer, you could just say ‘the rhinos just walked in and got lost trying to find their supervision room, the poor girls starved to death.’ All you have to do is convince one staff member that the rhinos were doing vital work for the scientific community and they’d bend over backwards to help you!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>22 Acres &#8211; Nah not a chance mate, have you ever used that field? It is the most perfectly smooth surface imaginable, basically an ice-skating rink in a grass-based form, I bet they have Doorsafe doing work on it (and I don’t say THAT lightly), that’s how perfect it is. Even if you could dig two pits for the rhinos you better dig a third for yourself as you’d never get the ground inch-perfect enough to hide what you did. Go on, why not dump those dead rhinos in front of the Mona Lisa while you’re at it if you have ART so much.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Lake &#8211; Do rhinos float? I am not sure, but my expertise on the physical properties of rhinos began fairly recently, around the time that the ‘£20 self-guided Safari’’ offer was going around, so I haven’t had the time to properly observe the Northern White Rhino in water. Hopefully it would sink and stay at the bottom, or even better the “”water”” would wash off the white paint and reveal them to be two regular rhinos, ending a horrible multi-continental prank that quite frankly has gone too far now.&nbsp; They were both females anyway, the species was doomed so it&#8217;s quite frankly ridiculous that you would launch a full-on manhunt for the person who killed them, if anything the (presumably handsome and charming) individual who did it saved a charity thousands of pounds by stopping a pointless conservation project.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Courtyard &#8211; Not sure this one would work in all honesty, there’s not enough space as it is to wear a mildly-large backpack around the tables let alone smuggle the dead bodies of two Northern White Rhinos. The only practical option is to hide them in the kitchen where they keep the meats, but even the culinary amoebas that roam the venue would be mad for the succulent, tender white rhino hide and riots would form when that limited edition burger goes off the menu.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fairhurst 2nd Floor &#8211; In my opinion this is one of the most guaranteed ways to hide the bodies of two Northern White Rhinos. All you have to do is paint their bodies (usefully already white so it can easily be used as a canvas) to look like the library desk booking system, then put them in the middle of Fairhurst and watch as everyone proceeds to FUCKING IGNORE IT. Like I&#8217;m sorry using a simple seat booking app was too much for you, I would hate for you to lose a precious second of loudly telling the person sat next to you about how you got off with someone in Salvos last night, clearly your need for my booked seat was greater, I’ll just consult the rhino corpse again and pray the next seat I book hasn’t been taken up by someone with an equally urgent need for a seat. God I wish it as half the population of Fairhurst who had wandered onto the road that afternoon instead of the white rhinos, who the fuck just let them roam about together anyway, with such lax security this was bound to happen at some point.</p>\n","author":{"node":{"name":"Dan Saxotweet"}},"featuredImage":{"node":{"id":"cG9zdDozMTI=","localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"id":"43449360-a73e-5ff7-bcc7-9ded12668435","gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/30e45ebce6da7e4d44a9b9f78e31d0d2/087da/2048px-Northern_White_Rhino.jpg","srcSet":"/static/30e45ebce6da7e4d44a9b9f78e31d0d2/5af8a/2048px-Northern_White_Rhino.jpg 512w,\n/static/30e45ebce6da7e4d44a9b9f78e31d0d2/9392e/2048px-Northern_White_Rhino.jpg 1024w,\n/static/30e45ebce6da7e4d44a9b9f78e31d0d2/087da/2048px-Northern_White_Rhino.jpg 2047w","sizes":"(min-width: 2047px) 2047px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/30e45ebce6da7e4d44a9b9f78e31d0d2/10d6b/2048px-Northern_White_Rhino.avif 512w,\n/static/30e45ebce6da7e4d44a9b9f78e31d0d2/11eb2/2048px-Northern_White_Rhino.avif 1024w,\n/static/30e45ebce6da7e4d44a9b9f78e31d0d2/72fd4/2048px-Northern_White_Rhino.avif 2047w","type":"image/avif","sizes":"(min-width: 2047px) 2047px, 100vw"},{"srcSet":"/static/30e45ebce6da7e4d44a9b9f78e31d0d2/e0e76/2048px-Northern_White_Rhino.webp 512w,\n/static/30e45ebce6da7e4d44a9b9f78e31d0d2/9c709/2048px-Northern_White_Rhino.webp 1024w,\n/static/30e45ebce6da7e4d44a9b9f78e31d0d2/4854e/2048px-Northern_White_Rhino.webp 2047w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 2047px) 2047px, 100vw"}]},"width":2047,"height":1364}}}}}},{"slug":"best-places-to-lose-your-virginity-around-york","title":"Best Places To Lose Your Virginity Around York","excerpt":"<p>Greg’s Place: On the condition that it is with someone named Greg.

Here are seven ways you can spot if your exam is just a harmless prank.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>1 &#8211; Your friend is being overly nice and helpful, why are they doing that? I bet they are just setting you up to be in the perfect location for a series of wacky hijinks to occur, but instead of the prank being explosions or aliens it is just a PDF file destroying your dream of getting a first.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>2 &#8211; The tensest part of any Prank Patrol show was when the prankee contacts the victim to set up the prank. I reject any offer to go out with friends or relatives out of fear that they could be pranking me, so if the university contacts you, it could be a sign that you’re about to be pranked! If you’ve opened the exam it means they have already got to you, but to avoid this in the future block everyone who works for the university, you can’t risk being pranked twice!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>3 &#8211; You couldn’t make a show like Prank Patrol these days, because nobody younger than 15 knows who Barney Harwood is, so if there are any stories in your area about terrified children being taken away in a big van by a man in his 40s, that almost definitely means the Prank Patrol is in your area and YOU could be next!&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>4 &#8211; You keep seeing a pair of purple ninjas running around. This should be the main giveaway really, not sure why this wasn’t reason number one.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>5 &#8211; All the pranks had a personal touch, so check to see if the exam questions have been designed to specifically piss YOU off. If all the questions are on your weak areas that you hope wouldn’t come up whilst everyone else seems happy with the questions that were asked, that’s not due to you being generally bad at the module, that’s a sign you’re being pranked by the Prank Patrol baby!&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>6 &#8211; Barney Harwood loves to insert himself into every prank, so be on the lookout of where the former I’m-A-Celeb-contestant-longlister could be hiding! Does the ridiculously hard question that isn’t covered in the lectures mention a ‘Harney Barwood’? Is the flatmate who was previously getting increasingly concerned about your mental wellbeing suddenly wearing a novelty mustache and sounding more Lancastian as you rant about how the lecturer has absolutely fucked you over? He could be anywhere, so make sure you are carrying mace.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>7 &#8211; At the end of every episode, there is a big reveal where everyone comes out to reveal the ruse. If you have finished your exam and haven&#8217;t seen a sign you have been pranked, just wait for it, I am sure someone is going to walk out from the wardrobe you’re currently crying beside with a loved one laughing at you! I bet they just need more crying footage for the b-roll, try looking distraught at a slightly different angle, they’ll all come out with the real exam soon&#8230;</p>\n","author":{"node":{"name":"Dan Saxotweet"}},"featuredImage":{"node":{"id":"cG9zdDoyNDc=","localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"id":"f1c227ec-7d8b-5a9a-98e6-13852412f1db","gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/c98a78be047a2cb988afacb6b6da4d28/97cbc/3458650039_b18a226c45_k1.jpg","srcSet":"/static/c98a78be047a2cb988afacb6b6da4d28/8cab2/3458650039_b18a226c45_k1.jpg 389w,\n/static/c98a78be047a2cb988afacb6b6da4d28/b4c91/3458650039_b18a226c45_k1.jpg 777w,\n/static/c98a78be047a2cb988afacb6b6da4d28/97cbc/3458650039_b18a226c45_k1.jpg 1554w","sizes":"(min-width: 1554px) 1554px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/c98a78be047a2cb988afacb6b6da4d28/e6f44/3458650039_b18a226c45_k1.avif 389w,\n/static/c98a78be047a2cb988afacb6b6da4d28/6ef09/3458650039_b18a226c45_k1.avif 777w,\n/static/c98a78be047a2cb988afacb6b6da4d28/4f3a8/3458650039_b18a226c45_k1.avif 1554w","type":"image/avif","sizes":"(min-width: 1554px) 1554px, 100vw"},{"srcSet":"/static/c98a78be047a2cb988afacb6b6da4d28/357c4/3458650039_b18a226c45_k1.webp 389w,\n/static/c98a78be047a2cb988afacb6b6da4d28/13efc/3458650039_b18a226c45_k1.webp 777w,\n/static/c98a78be047a2cb988afacb6b6da4d28/dfbc5/3458650039_b18a226c45_k1.webp 1554w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1554px) 1554px, 100vw"}]},"width":1554,"height":761}}}}}},{"slug":"top-tips-for-campus-living-college-by-college","title":"Top Tips For Campus Living: College-by-College","excerpt":"<p>Alcuin: Say ‘Morph Suit Man’ three times into a mirror to bring life to your party, and then have yours swiftly ended.

Maybe they’re completely unqualified for the job, or have no idea what they’re doing and have made wild and unachievable policies, and you’ve been burned by supporting a rival candidate. Well here’s the deal, if you’re really after sway you’ve got to do more than just casting your ballot. But why not take peaceful political action through democratic campaigning, speaking to students, and leafleting the shit out of campus, I hear you cry. Have you ever met the students who support the bad candidates? They’re mad, I tell you, completely bonkers, so you, the wise self-appointed philosopher king of campus, have to take matters into your own hands, and we’ve compiled our top tips on how to topple your opponents when they next come down the line.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First of all, you need campaign funds. There’s absolutely no limit as to how many people can stand in an election, or to how seriously they’re forced to take it, so for this ruse you’ll need as many people as you can to get in on the deal, ideally within a media group or public facing society. Then you all need to spend your entire YUSU pittance moneys on advertising and sponsorship, maybe you’ve got an insider in the group and they will let candidates sponsor individual letters to ensure there’s no limit to how many nominal backers you can get on a single page. If you get 30 people to cough up £30 budget, YUSU is obliged to give £900 to whatever group you got in on it. Maybe they get a nominal conmvenience fee, and then use collected shopping receipts to take out the money from YUSU finance to nab it into private accounts which then can be put into the campaign.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You have to be able to take advantage of a situation as well. Opportunities are created but also occasionally presented and you will lose if you don’t take up on them. For example, each voter has a login for an account they would use to vote with. If you were to… know those details, you quite literally control a larger voting block. It would be unethical for you to use computer trickery to try and source this information, but if a student hands it out? Well it’s your duty to use it. Of course, students would have to be mad to hand that out, and candidates even more so.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, the key to winning any campus election is shameless shameless self promotion. Lecture shoutouts aren’t enough anymore, you’ve got to shout at Greg’s Place, or better yet, from the top of central hall. Get more attention by standing on the very edge, crying and weeping. If your election run coincides with a local election, make sure to stand as a candidate there to get your sweet freepost across York. Break into students kitchens in the night to surprise them at breakfast time, canvas the private accommodation centers with leaflets in mandarin and cantanese. This is where your creativity can really take off, but be careful, this is where there’s the most opportunity for complaints to be lodged against you, so apply your self-promotion wisely.

We are grateful for your continued support and lack of a coordinated campaign for tuition fee refunds throughout last year, and we cannot wait to have you back.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like any university we are still facing some challenges as a result of the last 18 months, however, we have kept up our tradition of dealing with these in uniquely batshit-weird ways. To the students currently settling into their new homes in Hull, I say that I know this is not the start of the year that many of you may have signed up for, unless you are looking at this from a contractual standpoint, in which case we insist this is the start of the year that you signed up for.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, living in Hull is still a fantastic experience, so fantastic that we have generously given back to you 10% of your rent so that you have more income to spend at the many attractions and amusements in Hull. I have personally spent a lot of time in Hull, me and my family make trips to Hull every weekend to enjoy the culture and people there. I wanted to take this opportunity to share my own favorite places in Hull, to show you why you should be grateful we have let you live in such a wonderful city.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If I had to pick a favorite place, it would be The Deep. The Deep is a public aquarium situated at Sammy&#8217;s Point, at the confluence of the River Hull and the Humber Estuary in Hull, England. It opened in March 2002. Billed as &#8220;the world&#8217;s only submarium&#8221;,[4] the exhibits contain thousands of sea creatures (including seven species of shark), 2,500,000 litres (550,000 imp gal; 660,000 US gal) of water and 87 tonnes (96 short tons; 86 long tons) of salt housed in a building designed by Sir Terry Farrell and built as part of the UK National Lottery&#8217;s Millennium Commission project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Me and my family have also spent many happy days on The Humber Bridge, near Kingston upon Hull, East Riding of Yorkshire, England, is a 2.22 km (2,430 yd; 7,300 ft; 1.38 mi) single-span road suspension bridge, which opened to traffic on 24 June 1981. When it opened, the bridge was the longest of its type in the world; it was not surpassed until 1998, with the completion of the Akashi Kaikyō Bridge, and is now the eleventh-longest.

However, luckily for you, I was recently forwarded an antidote on whatsapp. Simply, mix some nutmeg into a pint of cum (home-made is best but store bought is fine)&nbsp; and chug it &#8211; this should counteract the effects of the toxins and get you back to full health in 3-5 business days.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n","author":{"node":{"name":"Lemon Press Writers"}},"featuredImage":{"node":{"id":"cG9zdDoxOTU=","localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"id":"58109190-8390-5fcf-b588-c789897f2517","gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAAFCAIAAADKYVtkAAAACXBIWXMAAAsTAAALEwEAmpwYAAABBElEQVQY001PPWvCUADMn3XyLwiCg4ubg4NOQkBwUBRUFDVSFImxmocxiEobTJO00RhiayUf712xAdvjuOHguDvOGo1eazVbknzXBQDG7kIpAFMQTEHALyLf17tdGgQAgstlkcnonQ63KRbt2cxdr7VG47RYnFcrWxS/LQuAlEop+fxZUc6q6hCiFgqOLPuuy8LwKZHQ6nXOIcQWRWMw2PP8vlLZ8fyh1QLgEPKcTm9KpZdq1RgOj5L01utNksnjfH41TZLLGf0+d1ouP6bT6HZ7bI418Lz38fhqGI8Xn5omZ7MAvO12Vy5/6ToXX7oHGGOUxvwzKWVRRMMQwKHd1prN/x0/e9EFafPDgEoAAAAASUVORK5CYII="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/460f2369b242bbdce6c8b8e6e5fdd68d/fe879/unnamed-7.png","srcSet":"/static/460f2369b242bbdce6c8b8e6e5fdd68d/aa6d7/unnamed-7.png 128w,\n/static/460f2369b242bbdce6c8b8e6e5fdd68d/12a1a/unnamed-7.png 256w,\n/static/460f2369b242bbdce6c8b8e6e5fdd68d/fe879/unnamed-7.png 512w","sizes":"(min-width: 512px) 512px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/460f2369b242bbdce6c8b8e6e5fdd68d/7232e/unnamed-7.avif 128w,\n/static/460f2369b242bbdce6c8b8e6e5fdd68d/27872/unnamed-7.avif 256w,\n/static/460f2369b242bbdce6c8b8e6e5fdd68d/72d74/unnamed-7.avif 512w","type":"image/avif","sizes":"(min-width: 512px) 512px, 100vw"},{"srcSet":"/static/460f2369b242bbdce6c8b8e6e5fdd68d/eb6cb/unnamed-7.webp 128w,\n/static/460f2369b242bbdce6c8b8e6e5fdd68d/fabd4/unnamed-7.webp 256w,\n/static/460f2369b242bbdce6c8b8e6e5fdd68d/7d2cb/unnamed-7.webp 512w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 512px) 512px, 100vw"}]},"width":512,"height":133}}}}}},{"slug":"dear-aunty-b-freshers-2021","title":"Dear Aunty B – Freshers 2021","excerpt":"<p>I’m starting in September and I’m anxious about meeting my new flatmates.

What if they don’t like me?</em> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Standing face to face with a brand new person can be daunting. It might be easier to introduce yourself with a wall between you. Try cutting a hole in your bedroom wall and putting your hand through to offer a strong handshake to your neighbour. You could also have a peek through to check their decor for any clues at their interests and try and change yourself into someone you think they’d like. For example, if you see they’ve got a trainspotting poster, invite them round for a spot of heroin. If all else fails and you just don’t get on with your flat, a great place to expand your social horizons is in Derwent Toilets Cubicle 3™.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I keep seeing this <em>girl that lives in my building and she’s really cute. How can I start a conversation and ask her out?</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If your building has a lift, this enclosed space where she can’t escape is a great place to strike. Try just making small talk, maybe comment on the state of your accommodation, to kick things off. If that goes well, try following her to her lectures (at a safe distance). If you’re lucky, she might notice your playful tailing and come knock on your door. This is a great opportunity to ask her to share in an interest of yours, such as inviting her to see you do stand-up. Next, call on her in a time of need to really cement your bond. Once you feel like you know her well enough, acquire a gun and break into her room to surprise her. If you follow these steps exactly, there&#8217;s a 100% chance of success.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Please help, everytime I go into a lecture theatre I immediately shit myself. What do I do now that things are back in person?</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It can be difficult to go against the grain, especially at the start of a new academic year. We all want to fit in with our peers, but you shouldn’t need to change who you are. Listen to your gut, and embrace the real you. When you turn up to your first lecture, confidently drop those trousers and pop a squat right at the front. I’m sure your fellow students will be moved and impressed by your bold gesture. I wouldn’t be surprised if some even opened their hearts and holes to join you in this completely normal and natural human experience. At the very least, it&#8217;s easier to clean up the floor than pants.</p>\n","author":{"node":{"name":"Lemon Press Writers"}},"featuredImage":{"node":{"id":"cG9zdDoxOTU=","localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"id":"58109190-8390-5fcf-b588-c789897f2517","gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAAFCAIAAADKYVtkAAAACXBIWXMAAAsTAAALEwEAmpwYAAABBElEQVQY001PPWvCUADMn3XyLwiCg4ubg4NOQkBwUBRUFDVSFImxmocxiEobTJO00RhiayUf712xAdvjuOHguDvOGo1eazVbknzXBQDG7kIpAFMQTEHALyLf17tdGgQAgstlkcnonQ63KRbt2cxdr7VG47RYnFcrWxS/LQuAlEop+fxZUc6q6hCiFgqOLPuuy8LwKZHQ6nXOIcQWRWMw2PP8vlLZ8fyh1QLgEPKcTm9KpZdq1RgOj5L01utNksnjfH41TZLLGf0+d1ouP6bT6HZ7bI418Lz38fhqGI8Xn5omZ7MAvO12Vy5/6ToXX7oHGGOUxvwzKWVRRMMQwKHd1prN/x0/e9EFafPDgEoAAAAASUVORK5CYII="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/460f2369b242bbdce6c8b8e6e5fdd68d/fe879/unnamed-7.png","srcSet":"/static/460f2369b242bbdce6c8b8e6e5fdd68d/aa6d7/unnamed-7.png 128w,\n/static/460f2369b242bbdce6c8b8e6e5fdd68d/12a1a/unnamed-7.png 256w,\n/static/460f2369b242bbdce6c8b8e6e5fdd68d/fe879/unnamed-7.png 512w","sizes":"(min-width: 512px) 512px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/460f2369b242bbdce6c8b8e6e5fdd68d/7232e/unnamed-7.avif 128w,\n/static/460f2369b242bbdce6c8b8e6e5fdd68d/27872/unnamed-7.avif 256w,\n/static/460f2369b242bbdce6c8b8e6e5fdd68d/72d74/unnamed-7.avif 512w","type":"image/avif","sizes":"(min-width: 512px) 512px, 100vw"},{"srcSet":"/static/460f2369b242bbdce6c8b8e6e5fdd68d/eb6cb/unnamed-7.webp 128w,\n/static/460f2369b242bbdce6c8b8e6e5fdd68d/fabd4/unnamed-7.webp 256w,\n/static/460f2369b242bbdce6c8b8e6e5fdd68d/7d2cb/unnamed-7.webp 512w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 512px) 512px, 100vw"}]},"width":512,"height":133}}}}}},{"slug":"spitebart-agony-uncle","title":"Spitebart Agony Uncle","excerpt":"<p>Dear Uncle, I am having confusing thoughts about my neighbor.

Mence. </em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you for your letter Pike, and what you are feeling is absolutely normal, many of us have been looking at those filthy traitorous Biden voters differently after they have said a few negative things about him. But you have to remember that they will never love the glorious United States of America and half the people in it, so the only relationship you need is one with the 2nd amendment. If you still want to do a casual thing however there are ways to make it not gay. The common mistake made is thinking that the only straight way to do head is to receive, however there is nothing more alpha than giving; a blindfold must be worn by both parties to prevent eye contact of course, but you must assert your alpha dominance by taking the entire thing at once and keeping it in your mouth like God intended. Either he will never come back or he will physically never be able to leave you, in both situations making you the dominant one if you believe hard enough.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dear Uncle, I wrote to you last time regarding an embarrassing misunderstanding of the female anatomy being cruelly exposed online, and after taking your advice I now fear my wife is too wet. We have had to put rail guards up to prevent her from slipping out of bed like an eel, she was sacked from her lifeguard job after flooding the shallow end, and now I need a pool noodle just to do our standard weekly missionary. Please help me un-wet my wife. Yours logically, Ben.&nbsp;</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hello Ben, it’s great to know my advice works, I especially hope you used my tip about ‘not podcasting during the act.’ If your wife is being too wet simply store the wife upside down; it’s well studied that water cannot travel uphill, so by keeping her flipped on her head all the moisture should be held within the womb. This is how babies are made. A few days of doing this whilst recording for your Youtube channel in the next room should prevent her from having this problem ever again.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dear Uncle, how would The Joker break up with someone who wanted them to stop acting like The Joker?

But The Joker is above all else a gentleman, who wears a suit and tricks both men and women equally, so you must break up with this lady with upmost dignity. Take her out to a fancy restaurant, order some Joker food (like beans on toast! This will make the chefs laugh, so it is what The Joker would order!), look her in the eye as you hold her hand and tell her ‘I’m allergic to beans.’ She will know right there and then where your heart truly lies, leaving you to spend your days as a single Joker man.&nbsp;</p>\n","author":{"node":{"name":"Dan Saxotweet"}},"featuredImage":null}]}}},{"node":{"slug":"lifestyle","name":"Lifestyle","posts":{"nodes":[{"slug":"the-worst-perfumes-to-mask-your-musk","title":"The Worst Perfumes To Mask Your Musk","excerpt":"<p>Eau de Fomite: If you are bored of feeling too sterile, have no fear as this perfume, filled with titillating infectious organisms, will put your mind at ease.

The move is rumoured to have been led by Michael Gove who made the decision for this career change a little while after his killer dance moves were spotted in the wild. When asked to comment on the matter Mr. Gove said “well, ultimately it’s always been a dream of mine to join a TikTok content house, what better time to do it than now, especially when I can convince other MPs who are looking for a job to do it with me.

This time Tom doesn’t need Michael Sheen backing him up, so listen to the pride of Britain cover every part of some of the biggest songs of the last century including Bohemian Rhapsody, WAP, Rap God and an authentic rendition of Eeny, Meeny, Miny, Moe (10 Minute Version).</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Captain Tom Morning After Pill </strong>&#8211; The only problem with the Captain Tom range of premium gins were that they were &#8216;too good&#8217; and led to &#8216;too many people making bad drunk decisions&#8217;.

In a recent interview, a teary-eyed Obama admitted his biggest regret was ‘not passing sensible throatgoat laws, it’s common sense that not everyone has the right to be a throatgoat.

You and him having such a shared experience does create a troubling precedent where you may have to feel good about your achievements in their own rights, rather than in comparison to someone else&#8217;s. However, you can instead take comfort from the fact the two of you did not go through this pandemic on equal footing, as experts have hypothesized that Steve could have purchased some additional mental strength from that money you lent him 5 years ago and never got back.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is an upside to this though, as now you can revel in the sense of superiority that their lockdown was made worse by them hurting over missing you every day&#8230; Probably.

As opposed to previous Non-Fungible Tokens these “Less-Fungible Tokens” will avoid the dastardly ctrl+c and ctrl+v that has swindled many an innocent cryptobro out of their hard-earned cartoon monkey photo by doing the unthinkable &#8211; creating physical copies of the art unable to be screenshot. That’s right, those less technologically inclined will now be able to get in on the action too through up-and-coming “irl auctions”.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The decision was met with many mixed opinions on social media, from one avid twitter user stating “irl auctions are literally already a thing that’s just an auction please go outside.” While another stated “Don’t care. Didn&#8217;t ask + ratio”. It is clear that it&#8217;s too soon to truly gauge the public opinion of LFTs, yet we can only speculate increasing demand over time as many are displayed in physical photo albums known as “art galleries”.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Earlier this week we got the opportunity to speak to one of the first new LFT owners themselves at none other than York University’s very own LFT testing centre. When asked for a comment he said, “So I walk in for my Covid test yeah, and the guy looks at me and he says ‘first time?’ So I say “nah mate” ‘cause we’re two years into this pandemic I think I know my way around an LFT by now. Anyways, he takes me into the little testing cubicle and I’m sitting there waiting for him to give me the testing kit or something, thinking this is a bit odd. I&#8217;m usually done by now. Shit you not the man comes back with a picture of a fucking monkey. So yeah, anyways. Probably given you covid now.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our reporter was unable to gleam more on the subject as immediately after this meeting they were notified of a need to self-isolate for the next 14 days, due to an unrelated contraction of Covid-19. But rest assured it seem like LFTs are here to stay, with many sightings of physical copies of images to be found already all over campus.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Interested in purchasing an LFT?

Could it be that he intentionally caused the other, actually talented Lewis to lose the 2021 Formula One World Drivers’ Championship so as to deflect accusations of favouritism towards a driver with the same name?

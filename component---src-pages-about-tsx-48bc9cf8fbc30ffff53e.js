Nationally recognised, The Lemon Press is one of York's most established and most awarded print media organisations. The print edition is produced once a term, with an additional freshers' edition, and online content is produced on a constant basis. Online, The Lemon Press has a national reach, with videos reaching almost 400,000 people. The Lemon Press has recently branched out onto new platforms, including a TikTok and Instagram, and our Multi-Media wing was recently responsible for a Call-To-Arms for supporters of exiled YUSU President Chris Small, which played before a screening of Cats at the student cinema."),i.createElement("div",{style:{gridColumn:"8/13"}},i.createElement("img",{src:"https://image.freepik.com/free-photo/group-coworkers-office-talking_23-2148985522.jpg",style:{width:"100%"}}),i.createElement("p",null,i.createElement("i",null,"Pretty much a standard lemon press meeting"))),i.createElement("div",{style:{gridColumn:"1/5"}},i.createElement("img",{src:"https://www.publicdomainpictures.net/pictures/220000/nahled/beautiful-bar-in-amsterdam.jpg",style:{width:"100%"}}),i.createElement("p",null,i.createElement("i",null,"D Bar on a cool winters night"))),i.createElement("p",{style:{gridColumn:"6/13",display:"flex",alignItems:"center"}},"Being part of The Lemon Press is collaborative, it's a great way to get involved with Student Politics, and other Media Societies.
